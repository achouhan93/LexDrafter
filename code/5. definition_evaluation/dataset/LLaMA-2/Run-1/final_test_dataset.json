                "The intervention through the MCM should be limited to addressing the most important deficiencies in the price formation system. The TTF month-ahead settlement price for derivatives is by far the most widely used benchmark in gas supply contracts across the Union, followed by maturities of two-months ahead and year-ahead. However, shifts of trade to derivatives linked to other VTPs may lead to distortions on Union energy or financial markets, for instance through arbitrage by market participants between corrected and non-corrected derivatives, to the detriment of consumers. Derivatives linked to all VTPs in the Union should therefore, in principle, be included in the MCM. However, the application of the MCM to derivatives linked to VTPs other than TTF is complex and requires additional technical preparation. With a view to the urgent need to introduce the MCM for the most important derivative, TTF derivative, the Commission should be given the power to define the technical details of the application of the MCM to derivatives linked to other VTPs and the selection of derivatives linked to other VTPs which may be excluded on the basis of pre-defined criteria by means of an implementing act.",
                "The MCM should not unduly jeopardise the continued proper functioning of the energy derivatives markets. Those markets play a key role in enabling market participants in hedging their positions in order to manage risks, in particular with regard to price volatility. Moreover, price interventions through the MCM can result in considerable financial losses for market participants in the derivatives markets. Given the size of the market for gas in the Union, such losses may not only affect the specialised derivatives markets, but may have significant knock-on effects on other financial markets. Price interventions could also lead to a detrimental increase in margin call due to uncertainty. A substantial increase in margin calls could result in considerable financial and liquidity losses for market participants, leading to the default of a clearing member or a final client. Relevant market participants should act in good faith and not unduly change risk management procedures resulting in an increase of margin calls, in particular if not in line with normal market procedures. Therefore, the Commission should immediately suspend the MCM if it jeopardises the orderly functioning of the derivatives market, for instance where it leads to a significant decrease in TTF derivatives transactions within the Union or to a significant shift of TTF-derivative transactions to trading venues outside the Union. In that regard, it is important that the Commission takes into account available expertise from relevant Union bodies. ESMA is an independent authority that contributes to safeguarding the stability of the Union\u2019s financial system, notably by promoting stable and orderly financial markets, such as the derivative markets.",
                "The dynamic bidding limit should not affect OTC transactions, as applying that limit to OTC transactions would raise serious monitoring issues and may lead to problems with the security of supply. However, a review mechanism should apply to assess whether the exclusion of OTC transactions may lead to significant shifts of TTF derivatives trading to OTC markets, thereby endangering the stability of financial or energy markets.",

Derivatives linked to all VTPs in the Union should therefore, in principle, be included in the MCM. However, the application of the MCM to derivatives linked to VTPs other than TTF is complex and requires additional technical preparation. With a view to the urgent need to introduce the MCM for the most important derivative,TTF derivative, the Commission should be given the power to define the technical details of the application of the MCM to derivatives linked to other VTPs and the selection of derivatives linked to other VTPs which may be excluded on the basis of pre-defined criteria by means of an implementing act."

Once the conditions for activation of the MCM are met, ACER should publish a notice immediately on its website stating that the triggering conditions for the activation of the MCM have been met. The following day, market operators should not accept any orders above the dynamic bidding limit and TTF derivatives market participants should not submit such orders. Market operators and TTF derivatives market participants should monitor the website of ACER where the daily reference price should be published. A similar dynamic bidding limit should apply to derivatives linked to other VTPs under the conditions defined in the implementing act concerning the application of the MCM to such derivatives.",
                "The MCM is necessary and proportionate in achieving the objective of correcting excessively high gas prices at the TTF and derivatives linked to other VTPs. All Member States are concerned by the indirect effects of the price hikes, such as increasing energy prices and inflation. As regards the deficiencies in the price formation system, such deficiencies play a different role in various Member States, with price increases being more representative in some Member States (e. g. Central European Member States) than in other Member States (e. g. Member States at the periphery or with other supply possibilities). In order to avoid a fragmented action, which could divide the integrated Union gas market, common action is needed in a spirit of solidarity. This is also crucial in order to ensure the security of supply in the Union. Moreover, common safeguards, which may be more necessary in Member States without supply alternatives than in Member States with supply alternatives, should ensure a coordinated approach as an expression of energy solidarity. Indeed, while the financial risks and benefits are very different for various Member States, the MCM should constitute a solidary compromise, in which all Member States agree to contribute to the market correction and accept the same limits for the price formation, even though the level of malfunction of the price formation mechanism and the financial impacts of derivatives prices on the economy are different in some Member States. The MCM would therefore strengthen Union solidarity in avoiding excessively high gas prices, which are unsustainable even for short periods of time for many Member States. The MCM will help to ensure that gas supply undertakings from all Member States are able to purchase gas at reasonable prices in the spirit of solidarity.",
                "The intervention through the MCM should be limited to addressing the most important deficiencies in the price formation system. The TTF month-ahead settlement price for derivatives is by far the most widely used benchmark in gas supply contracts across the Union, followed by maturities of two-months ahead and year-ahead. However, shifts of trade to derivatives linked to otherVTPs may lead to distortions on Union energy or financial markets, for instance through arbitrage by market participants between corrected and non-corrected derivatives, to the detriment of consumers. Derivatives linked to all VTPs in the Union should therefore, in principle, be included in the MCM. However, the application of the MCM to derivatives linked to VTPs other than TTF is complex and requires additional technical preparation. With a view to the urgent need to introduce the MCM for the most important derivative,TTF derivative, the Commission should be given the power to define the technical details of the application of the MCM to derivatives linked to other VTPs and the selection of derivatives linked to other VTPs which may be excluded on the basis of pre-defined criteria by means of an implementing act."

Furthermore, it is of key importance for the security of supply that the corrected TTF-derivative price is set at a sufficiently high level to attract LNG imports from other regions in the world. Security of supply premium should therefore be put on the reference price for the calculation of the corrected TTF-derivative price. The formula for the safety ceiling should be fully dynamic, based on a dynamically developing basket of prices reflecting world market prices, and should serve as a certain safety margin to ensure that the security of supply is not at risk.

Furthermore, it is of key importance for the security of supply that the corrected TTF-derivative price is set at a sufficiently high level to attract LNG imports from other regions in the world. Security of supply premium should therefore be put on the reference price for the calculation of the corrected TTF-derivative price. The formula for the safety ceiling should be fully dynamic, based on a dynamically developing basket of prices reflecting world market prices, and should serve as a certain safety margin to ensure that the security of supply is not at risk. The dynamic safety ceiling can vary every day on the basis of the evolution of global prices contained in the basket.",
                "ACER should continuously monitor whether the conditions for the operation of the MCM are fulfilled. ACER is the best placed authority to carry out such monitoring, because it has a Union-wide view of gas markets and the necessary expertise in the operation of gas markets, and is already mandated to monitor trading activities in wholesale energy products under Union law. ACER should therefore monitor the evolution of the front-month TTF settlement price and compare it to thereference price, determined by the average price of LNG price assessments linked to European trading hubs, in order to verify whether the conditions that justify the activation or deactivation of the MCM are met. Once the conditions for activation of the MCM are met, ACER should publish a notice immediately on its website stating that the triggering conditions for the activation of the MCM have been met. The following day, market operators should not accept any orders above the dynamic bidding limit andTTF derivatives market participants should not submit such orders.Market operators and TTF derivatives market participants should monitor the website of ACER where the daily reference price should be published. A similar dynamic bidding limit should apply to derivatives linked to otherVTPs under the conditions defined in the implementing act concerning the application of the MCM to such derivatives.",
                "The MCM should not jeopardise the Union\u2019s security of gas supply by constraining price signals that are essential in attracting necessary gas supplies and intra-Union flows of gas. Gas providers may in fact potentially withhold supplies when the MCM is activated to maximise profits by selling shortly after the deactivation of the safety ceiling. In case the MCM would lead to such risks for the Union\u2019s security of gas supply, but where no regional or Union emergency is declared, the Commission should immediately suspend the MCM. The elements to be taken into account in the assessment of security of supply risks should include a potential significant deviation of one of the components of the reference price compared to the historical trend, and a significant drop of quarterly LNG imports into the Union compared to the same quarter of the previous year.",

                "A dynamic safety ceiling should therefore ensure that trading orders which would be significantly above LNG prices in other regions of the world are not accepted. Appropriate benchmarks should be used to determine areference price reflecting global LNG price trends. The reference price should be based on LNG price assessments representative of the European market conditions and, due to the particular importance of the United Kingdom and Asia as competitors in the global LNG market, also on an appropriate benchmark for the United Kingdom and Asian regions. In contrast to pipeline gas, LNG is traded world-wide. Therefore, LNG prices better reflect the gas price developments at global level and can serve as a benchmark to assess whether price levels in continental hubs abnormally diverge from international prices."

Some of those measures are of general scope, such as the introduction of a rebuttable presumption that renewable energy projects are of overriding public interest for the purposes of the relevant environmental legislation, or the introduction of clarification regarding the scope of certain environmental directives as well as the simplification of the permit-granting framework for the repowering of renewable energy power plants by focusing on the impact stemming from the changes or extensions compared to the original project.

The measures set out in this Regulation are directed at renewable energy installations in all Member States and capture a wide scope of projects, including on existing structures, new installations of solar energy equipment and repowering of existing installations. Given the degree of integration of Union energy markets, any increase in renewable energy deployment in a Member State should be beneficial also to other Member States in terms of security of supply and lower prices. It should help renewable electricity flow across the borders to where it is most needed and ensure that renewable electricity produced at low cost is exported to Member States where electricity production is more expensive.

Furthermore, the efficient use of the existing infrastructure, including cross-border transmission capacities and LNG facilities, is important to safeguard the security of the gas supply in a spirit of solidarity. In times of gas supply disruptions at Union, regional or national level, and a significant switch from pipeline gas to LNG, Member States in a severe crisis situation should not only be able to benefit from supply possibilities from neighbouring pipelines, but also from supplies from countries which dispose of an LNG facility. Some Member States should be in a position to provide solidarity to other Member States, even if they are not directly connected via a gas pipeline or through a third country or other Member States, provided that the Member State requesting solidarity has exhausted all market-based measures in its emergency plan, including LNG purchases in the global market. It is therefore appropriate to expand the obligation to provide solidarity to non-connected Member States with LNG facilities, taking into account the differences between pipeline gas and LNG markets and infrastructure, including LNG vessels and carriers, in imposing obligations on operators, and taking into account the lack of enforcement powers with respect to LNG assets such as LNG carriers and including possibilities to swap between natural gas and LNG if there is no gas liquefaction facility on the territory of a Member State providing solidarity.",

                "In order to effectively use the joint purchasing and to conclude gas agreements with suppliers offering gas to the service provider, undertakings should be able to coordinate conditions of the purchase, such as volumes, gas price, delivery points and time, within the limits of Union law. Undertakings participating in a gas purchasing consortium should, however, ensure that the information directly or indirectly exchanged is limited to what is strictly necessary to achieve the objective pursued, in line with Article 101 TFEU. In addition, the transparency and governance provisions of this Regulation should ensure that contracts of the buying consortium do not endanger security of supply or jeopardise energy solidarity, in particular where Member States are directly or indirectly involved in the purchase process.",

A first reference to the possibility of a very limited form of joint purchasing of gas for balancing purposes is already included in the Commission\u2019s proposal for a Regulation on the internal markets for renewable and natural gases and for hydrogen. However, that proposal dates from a time before the Russian Federation\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine. Furthermore, no detailed concept was included in that proposal, which only concerned the very specific needs of transmission system operators for balancing energy. As an immediate and much more comprehensive solution to the problem of missing structures for coordinated gas purchasing is needed, it is appropriate to propose a temporary fast-track solution."

Therefore, the cap onmarket revenues should not be set below the reasonable expectations of market participants as to the average level of electricity prices in the hours during which the demand for electricity was at its highest, before Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine. Before February 2022, the average peak prices in the electricity wholesale market were significantly and consistently expected below 180 EUR per MWh across the Union in the last decades, despite the differences in electricity prices between regions in the Union. Since the initial investment decision of market participants was taken based on an expectation that, on average, the prices would be lower than that level duringpeak hours, setting the cap on market revenues at a 180 EUR per MWh constitutes a level well above those initial market expectations. By leaving a margin on the price that investors could reasonably have expected, it is necessary to ensure that the cap on market revenues does not counteract the initial assessment of investment profitability.",

Regardless of the contractual form in which the trade of electricity may take place, the cap on market revenues should apply to realised market revenues only. This is necessary to avoid harming producers who do not actually benefit from the current high electricity prices due to having hedged their revenues against fluctuations in the wholesale electricity market. Hence, to the extent that existing or future contractual obligations, such as renewable power purchase agreements and other types of power purchase agreements or forward hedges, lead to market revenues from the production of electricity up to the level of the cap on market revenues, such revenues should remain unaffected by this Regulation.

                "To account for security of supply concerns, Member States should have the possibility to set the cap onmarket revenues in a way that allows the electricity producers to retain 10 % of thesurplus revenues above the cap on market revenues.",
                "Uncoordinated caps on market revenues from electricity produced from generators with lower marginal costs such as renewables, nuclear and lignite (\u2018inframarginal generators\u2019) may lead to significant distortions between generators in the Union, as generators compete Union-wide on a coupled electricity market. A commitment to a joint Union-wide cap on market revenues from inframarginal generators should enable avoidance of such distortions. Furthermore, not all Member States can support consumers to the same extent due to limited financial resources, while at the same time, some electricity generators may continue enjoying significant surplus revenues. Solidarity between Member States through the Union-wide cap on market revenues should generate revenues for Member States to finance measures in support of final electricity customers, such as households, small and medium-sized enterprises (\u2018SMEs\u2019) and energy intensive industries, while at the same time preserving the price signals on the markets across the Union and preserving cross-border trade.",
                "Regular and effective monitoring and reporting to the Commission are essential for the assessment of progress made by the Member States in the achievement of the demand reduction targets, the implementation of the cap on market revenues, the use of the surplus revenues, and the application of regulated prices.",
                "To ensure coherence across energy policy areas, the measures provided for in this Regulation should work as an interdependent package reinforcing each other. All Member States should be able to support consumers, in a targeted manner, through surplus revenues resulting from the cap on market revenues, through the reduction of electricity demand, which contributes to lowering energy prices, and through proceeds from a solidarity contribution imposed on Union companies and permanent establishments with activities in the crude petroleum, natural gas, coal and refinery sectors. At the same time, lower demand should have positive effects in terms of reducing the risks to security of supply, in line with the objectives set out in Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4).",
                "Member States should ensure that the surplus revenues resulting from the application of the cap on market revenues in the field of electricity are passed on to final electricity customers to mitigate the impact of exceptionally high electricity prices. The surplus revenues should be targeted at customers, including both households and companies, who are particularly strongly affected by high electricity prices. Without the proposed measures, there is a risk that only wealthier Member States will have the resources to protect their consumers, leading to severe distortions in the internal market.",

In this respect, such proceeds should be used, for instance, for the purpose of demand reduction auctions or tender schemes, lowering the energy purchase costs of final energy customers for certain volumes of energy consumption, or promoting investments by final energy customers, both vulnerable households and companies, into renewables, energy efficiency investments or other decarbonisation technologies.

Costs in energy intensive industries, such as the fertiliser industry, are skyrocketing due to soaring energy prices. Financial support measures are to be made conditional upon investments into renewable energies, energy efficiency, or other decarbonisation technologies.

All Member States should be able to support consumers, in a targeted manner, throughsurplus revenuesresulting from the cap onmarket revenues, through the reduction of electricity demand, which contributes to lowering energy prices, and through proceeds from asolidarity contributionimposed onUnion companies and permanent establishments with activities in the crude petroleum, natural gas, coal and refinery sectors. At the same time, lower demand should have positive effects in terms of reducing the risks to security of supply, in line with the objectives set out in Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4).",
                "In particular, Member States should target financial support measures to the most vulnerable households and companies, which are most affected from the soaring energy prices. This would preserve the price incentive to reduce energy demand and save energy. In addition, targeting most vulnerable and liquidity-constrained households would have a positive effect on overall consumption by averting excessive crowding out of spending on non-energy goods, given the high-income propensity to consume for that group of households. Moreover, the proceeds of thesolidarity contributionshould be used for fostering the reduction of energy consumption. In this respect, such proceeds should be used, for instance, for the purpose of demand reduction auctions or tender schemes, lowering the energy purchase costs offinal energy customers for certain volumes of energy consumption, or promoting investments by final energy customers, both vulnerable households and companies, into renewables, energy efficiency investments or other decarbonisation technologies. The proceeds from the solidarity contribution should also be used for financially supporting companies in energy intensive industries, and in regions relying on those industries. Costs in energy intensive industries, such as the fertiliser industry, are skyrocketing due to soaring energy prices. Financial support measures are to be made conditional upon investments into renewable energies, energy efficiency, or other decarbonisation technologies. Furthermore, measures which help making the Union more autonomous in the energy field should be supported with investments in accordance with the objectives set in the Commission Communication of 8 March 2022 on REPowerEU: Joint European Action for more affordable, secure and sustainable energy (\u2018the REPowerEU Joint European Action\u2019) and in the REPowerEU Plan, in particular for projects with a cross-border dimension.",
                "Commercial and trading practices as well as the regulatory framework in the electricity sector are markedly different from the fossil fuels sector. Given that the cap on market revenues aims to mimic the market outcome that producers could have expected if global supply chains would function normally in the absence of gas supply disruptions since February 2022, it is necessary for the measure concerning electricity producers to apply to the revenues resulting from the generation of electricity. Conversely, as the temporary solidarity contribution targets the profitability of Union companies and permanent establishments with activities in the crude petroleum, natural gas, coal and refinery sectors which has significantly increased compared to prior years, it is necessary for it to apply to their profits.",

Soaring energy prices affect all Member States. However, because of the differences in their respective energy mixes, Member States are not all impacted in the same way and do not all have the same fiscal space to take the necessary measures to protect vulnerable households and companies. In the absence of a Union measure such as a solidarity contribution, there is a high risk of disruption and further fragmentation of the internal market, which would be detrimental to all Member States, given the integration of energy markets and of value chains. Tackling energy poverty and addressing the social consequences of the energy crisis, in particular to protect workers in exposed industries, are also a matter of solidarity between Member States. To maximise its impact, the use of the proceeds of the solidarity contribution should be done in a coordinated way and/or through Union financing instruments in a spirit of solidarity.",

Therefore, in order to promptly address the specific challenges of the ongoing and anticipated severe worsening of gas supply shortages and avoid distortions between Member States, a new instrument introducing the possibility for a mandatory gas demand reduction for all Member States should be established. It should become operational sufficiently in advance of autumn 2022.

Conferring an implementing power on the Council adequately takes into account the political nature of the decision to trigger a mandatory Union-wide demand-reduction obligation and its horizontal implications for Member States. Before presenting such a proposal, the Commission should consult the relevant risk groups, as set out in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 (\u2018risk groups\u2019), and the Gas Coordination Group (GCG), established by that Regulation. A Union alert should only be declared in the event that the voluntary demand-reduction measures prove to be insufficient to address the risk of a serious supply shortage.

It is therefore warranted that the Commission supervise strictly that the mandatory demand reductions are carried out by Member States. In the event that the Commission identifies a risk that a Member State may not be able to fulfil its mandatory demand-reduction obligation, the Commission should be able to request that Member State to submit a plan setting out a strategy and measures to effectively achieve the mandatory demand reduction.

Appropriate emission factors, including upstream emissions, must be used to account for the emissions from the production of chemical fertilisers and pesticides pursuant to Annex IX.

The audit intensity, its scope, or both, should be adapted to the level of identified overall risk in order to ensure an adequate level of trust in the veracity of the information provided by the economic operators, mitigating the risks for material misstatements.",

However, in order to prevent an economic operator that has failed an audit under one scheme from immediately applying for certification under another scheme, all schemes receiving an application from an economic operator should require that operator to supply information about whether it failed an audit in the previous 5 years. This should also apply to situations where the economic operator has a new legal personality but remains the same in substance, so that minor or purely formal changes, for instance, in the governance structure or the scope of activities, do not exempt the new economic operator from such a rule.",

Given the urgency of developing energy infrastructures, the simplification of the permit granting process should set a clear time limit for the decision of the relevant authorities regarding the construction of the project. That time limit should stimulate a more efficient definition and handling of procedures, and should under no circumstances compromise the high standards for the protection of the environment in line with environmental legislation and public participation. This Regulation should establish maximum time limits. However, Member States can strive to achieve shorter time limits where feasible and, in particular, as regards projects such as smart grids, which may not require as complex a permitting process as that for transmission infrastructure. The competent authorities should be responsible for ensuring compliance with the time limits.",

While there has been very significant progress in the completion of that market, there is still room for improvement by better utilising existing energy infrastructure, integrating the increasing amounts of renewable energy, and system integration.",

To achieve higher levels of greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest, Europe will need a more integrated energy system, relying on higher levels of electrification based on additional renewable and low-carbon sources and the decarbonisation of the gas sector. The trans-European energy networks policy can ensure that the Unionenergy infrastructure development supports the required energy transition to climate neutrality in line with the energy efficiency first principle and technological neutrality while considering the potential for emission reduction in the end use. It can also ensure interconnections, energy security, market and system integration, and competition that benefits all Member States, as well as energy at an affordable price for households and undertakings.",

In the light of the economic and financial situation and budgetary constraints, targeted support, through grants and financial instruments, should continue under the multiannual financial framework, in order to maximise the benefits to Union citizens and to attract new investors into theenergy infrastructure priority corridors and areas set out in an annex to this Regulation, while keeping the budgetary contribution of the Union to a minimum."

Projects of common interest in electricity and gas have strongly contributed to security of supply. For gas, the infrastructure is now better connected and supply resilience has improved substantially since 2013. Regional cooperation in regional groups and through cross-border cost allocation is an important enabler for project implementation. However, in many cases the cross-border cost allocation did not result in reducing the financing gap of the projects, as intended. While the majority of permitting procedures have been shortened, in some cases the process is still long. The financial assistance from the Connecting Europe Facility, established by Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), has been an important factor as grants for studies have helped projects to reduce risks in the early stages of development, while grants for works have supported projects addressing key bottlenecks that market finance could not sufficiently address.",

It is important to avoid any distortion of competition, in particular between projects contributing to the achievement of the same Union priority corridor. Such financial assistance should ensure the necessary synergies with the Structural Funds, in order to finance smart energy distribution networks, and with the Union renewable energy financing mechanism established by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1294 (25), pursuant to Article 33(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (26).",

Second, if investments are not made by the market, regulatory solutions should be explored, the relevant regulatory framework should be adjusted if necessary, and the correct application of the relevant regulatory framework should be ensured. Third, where the first two steps are not sufficient to deliver the necessary investments in projects of common interest, it should be possible to grant Union financial assistance where the project of common interest fulfils the applicable eligibility criteria. Projects of common interest may also be eligible under the InvestEU programme, which is complementary to grant financing.",

In addition, that requires stepping up investment in offshore renewable energy with the aim of reaching at least 300 GW of offshore wind generation installed in line with the Commission\u2019s offshore renewable energy strategy set out in the Commission communication of 19 November 2020 entitled \u2018An EU Strategy to harness the potential of offshore renewable energy for a climate neutral future\u2019. That strategy includes radial links connecting new offshore wind capacities, as well as hybrid integrated projects. Coordinating long-term planning and development of offshore and onshore electricity grids should also be addressed. In particular, offshore infrastructure planning should move away from the project-by-project approach towards a coordinated comprehensive approach ensuring the sustainable development of integrated offshore grids in line with the offshore renewable potential of each sea basin, environmental protection and other uses of the sea.

                "The internal energy market legislation requires that tariffs for access to networks provide appropriate incentives for investment. However, several types of projects of common interest are likely to have externalities that might not be fully captured in, and recovered through, the regular tariff system. In applying the internal energy market legislation, national regulatory authorities should ensure a stable and predictable regulatory and financial framework with incentives for projects of common interest, including long-term incentives, that are commensurate with the level of specific risk of the project. That framework should apply in particular to cross-border projects, innovative transmission technologies for electricity allowing for the large scale integration of renewable energy, of distributed energy resources or of demand response in interconnected networks, and energy technology and digitalisation projects, which are either likely to incur higher risks than similar projects located within one Member State or which promise higher benefits for the Union. Moreover, projects with high operational expenditure should also have access to appropriate incentives for investment. In particular, offshore grids for renewable energy, which serve the dual functionality of electricity interconnectors and connecting renewable offshore generation projects, are likely to incur higher risks than comparable onshore infrastructure projects, due to their intrinsic connection to generation assets which brings regulatory risks, financing risks such as the need for anticipatory investments, market risks and risks pertaining to the use of new innovative technologies.",

Therefore, among other aspects, both climate mitigation and climate adaptation objectives need to be adequately reflected in the revised trans-European energy networks framework. Besides the new political context and objectives, technological development has been rapid in the past decade. That development should be taken into account in the energy infrastructure categories covered by this Regulation, the selection criteria for projects of common interest as well as the priority corridors and areas. At the same time, the provisions of this Regulation should not affect a Member State\u2019s right to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply, in accordance with Article 194 TFEU.",

That objective should be attained by allowing projects under development or planning that have been granted the status of project of common interest under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 to maintain their status until Cyprus and Malta are interconnected to the trans-European gas network. Apart from contributing to the development of the renewable energy market, the flexibility and resilience of the energy system, and the security of supply, those projects will ensure access to future energy markets, including hydrogen, and contribute to achieving the Union\u2019s overall energy and climate policy objectives.",

On the other hand, the consumption of biogas, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic gaseous fuels is expected to increase significantly towards 2050. For gas, the infrastructure is now better connected and supply resilience has improved substantially since 2013. The planning of energy infrastructure should reflect this changing gas landscape. However, not all Member States are yet connected sufficiently to the European gas network and island Member States in particular continue to face significant challenges in terms of security of supply and energy isolation. Although 78 % of gas projects that are projects of common interest are expected to be commissioned by the end of 2025, a number of them are experiencing significant delays, including due to permitting problems. This Regulation should therefore not negatively affect projects of common interest that have not yet been completed on the date of its entry into force. Therefore, projects of common interest included in the fifth Union list of projects of common interest established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 347/2013, for which an application file has been accepted for examination by the competent authority should be able to maintain their rights and obligations as regards permitting for a period of four years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation.",

That time limit should stimulate a more efficient definition and handling of procedures, and should under no circumstances compromise the high standards for the protection of the environment in line with environmental legislation and public participation. This Regulation should establish maximum time limits. However, Member States can strive to achieve shorter time limits where feasible and, in particular, as regards projects such as smart grids, which may not require as complex a permitting process as that for transmission infrastructure. The competent authorities should be responsible for ensuring compliance with the time limits.",
                "Security of supply, as a main driver behind the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013, has been significantly improved throughprojects of common interest.

On the other hand, the consumption of biogas, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and synthetic gaseous fuels is expected to increase significantly towards 2050. For gas, the infrastructure is now better connected and supply resilience has improved substantially since 2013. The planning ofenergy infrastructure should reflect this changing gas landscape. However, not all Member States are yet connected sufficiently to the European gas network and island Member States in particular continue to face significant challenges in terms of security of supply and energy isolation. Although 78 % of gas projects that are projects of common interest are expected to be commissioned by the end of 2025, a number of them are experiencing significant delays, including due to permitting problems. This Regulation should therefore not negatively affect projects of common interest that have not yet been completed on the date of its entry into force. Therefore, projects of common interest included in the fifth Union list of projects of common interest established pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 347/2013, for which an application file has been accepted for examination by the competent authority should be able to maintain their rights and obligations as regards permitting for a period of four years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation.",

                "The internal energy market legislation requires that tariffs for access to networksprovide appropriate incentives for investment. However, several types ofprojects of common interest are likely to have externalities that might not be fully captured in, and recovered through, the regular tariff system. In applying the internal energy market legislation, national regulatory authorities should ensure a stable and predictable regulatory and financial framework with incentives for projects of common interest, including long-term incentives, that are commensurate with the level of specific risk of the project. That framework should apply in particular to cross-border projects, innovative transmission technologies for electricity allowing for the large scale integration of renewable energy, of distributed energy resources or of demand response in interconnected networks, and energy technology and digitalisation projects, which are either likely to incur higher risks than similar projects located within one Member State or which promise higher benefits for the Union. Moreover, projects with high operational expenditure should also have access to appropriate incentives for investment. In particular, offshore grids for renewable energy, which serve the dual functionality of electricity interconnectors and connecting renewable offshore generation projects, are likely to incur higher risks than comparable onshore infrastructure projects, due to their intrinsic connection to generation assets which brings regulatory risks, financing risks such as the need for anticipatory investments, market risks and risks pertaining to the use of new innovative technologies.",

That objective should be attained by allowingprojects under development or planning that have been granted the status ofproject of common interest under Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 to maintain their status until Cyprus and Malta are interconnected to the trans-European gas network. Apart from contributing to the development of the renewable energy market, the flexibility and resilience of the energy system, and the security of supply, those projects will ensure access to future energy markets, including hydrogen, and contribute to achieving the Union\u2019s overall energy and climate policy objectives.",

For gas, the infrastructure is now better connected and supply resilience has improved substantially since 2013. Regional cooperation in regional groups and through cross-border cost allocation is an important enabler for project implementation. However, in many cases the cross-border cost allocation did not result in reducing the financing gap of the projects, as intended. While the majority of permitting procedures have been shortened, in some cases the process is still long. The financial assistance from the Connecting Europe Facility, established by Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), has been an important factor as grants forstudies have helped projects to reduce risks in the early stages of development, while grants for works have supported projects addressing key bottlenecks that market finance could not sufficiently address.",

The existingenergy infrastructurecategories for electricity transmission and storage are crucial for the integration of the significant increase in renewable electricity generation in the power grid. In addition, that requires stepping up investment in offshore renewable energy with the aim of reaching at least 300 GW of offshore wind generation installed in line with the Commission\u2019s offshore renewable energy strategy set out in the Commission communication of 19 November 2020 entitled \u2018An EU Strategy to harness the potential of offshore renewable energy for a climate neutral future\u2019. That strategy includes radial links connecting new offshore wind capacities, as well as hybrid integratedprojects. Coordinating long-term planning and development of offshore and onshore electricity grids should also be addressed. In particular, offshore infrastructure planning should move away from the project-by-project approach towards a coordinated comprehensive approach ensuring the sustainable development of integrated offshore grids in line with the offshore renewable potential of each sea basin, environmental protection and other uses of the sea. There should be an approach based on voluntary cooperation between Member States.

In deciding on cross-border cost allocation, national regulatory authorities should allocate efficiently incurred investment costs, as relevant in view of their national approaches and methodologies for similar infrastructure, across borders in their entirety and include them in the national tariffs, and, afterwards, if relevant, determine whether their impact on national tariffs could represent a disproportionate burden for consumers in their respective Member States. The national regulatory authorities should avoid the risks of double support for projects by taking into account actual or estimated charges and revenues. Those charges and revenues should be taken into account only in so far as they relate to the projects, and are designed to cover the costs concerned."

Such infrastructure should consist of a significant extent of assets converted from natural gas assets, complemented by new assets dedicated to hydrogen. Furthermore, the Hydrogen Strategy set a strategic goal to increase installed electrolyser capacity to 40 Gigawatts (GW) by 2030 in order to scale up the production of renewable hydrogen and facilitate the decarbonisation of fossil-fuel dependent sectors, such as industry or transport. Therefore, the trans-European energy networks policy should include new and repurposed hydrogen transmission infrastructure and storage as well as electrolyser facilities.

Moreover, projects with high operational expenditure should also have access to appropriate incentives for investment. In particular, offshore grids for renewable energy, which serve the dual functionality of electricity interconnectors and connecting renewable offshore generation projects, are likely to incur higher risks than comparable onshore infrastructure projects, due to their intrinsic connection to generation assets which brings regulatory risks, financing risks such as the need for anticipatory investments, market risks and risks pertaining to the use of new innovative technologies.",

The trans-European energy networks policy can ensure that the Unionenergy infrastructure development supports the required energy transition to climate neutrality in line with the energy efficiency first principle and technological neutrality while considering the potential for emission reduction in the end use. It can also ensure interconnections, energy security, market and system integration, and competition that benefits all Member States, as well as energy at an affordable price for households and undertakings."
