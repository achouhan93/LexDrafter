      "The timely availability of complete sets of data on fundamentals should also increase the security of energy supplies. It should allow market parties to precisely match supply and demand reducing the risk for black-outs. As a result TSOs should be able to better control their networks and operate them under more predictable and secure conditions.",
      "Through the rapid deployment of intermittent generation sources away from consumption centres, transmission infrastructure has increasingly got congested in large parts of Europe. To relieve congestions TSOs have increasingly intervened in market operations instructing market participants to change their generation or trading commitments. In order to enable the market to understand where and why congestion management measures have become necessary, TSOs need to provide timely, detailed and reasoned information about their actions.",
      "Even after careful planning producers, suppliers and traders may find themselves out of balance and be exposed to TSOs balancing and settlement regime. In order to optimally mitigate imbalance risk market participants need accurate, clear and timely information about balancing markets. TSOs should provide such information in a comparable format across borders including details about the reserves they have contracted, prices paid and volumes activated for balancing purposes.",

      "The availability of such data is indispensable for market participants\u2019 ability to take efficient production, consumption and trading decisions. Deeper market integration and the rapid development of intermittent renewable energy generation sources such as wind and solar require the disclosure of complete, timely available, high quality and easily digestible information relating to supply and demand fundamentals."
