This functional reference architecture specifies a generic representation of smart metering infrastructures used in Member States. It defines the so-called \u2018H1\u2019, \u2018H2\u2019 and \u2018H3\u2019 interfaces that may be used for the provision of non-validated near real-time data.

Procedures 5 and 6 are implementation-neutral with respect to the access method provided.",

If required, it de-crypts the data using the cipher provided by the meter operator in step 5.3. It is recommended that at the end of step 6.3, attributes of information object P must be available in a form that can easily be used in the follow-up processes. When mapping this step, it is not enough to refer to a standard - descriptions of all necessary steps must be provided exhaustively.",
