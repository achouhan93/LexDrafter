  "original_definition": "'off mode' means a condition in which the equipment is connected to the mains power source and is not providing any function; the following shall also be considered as off mode:conditions providing only an indication of off-mode condition;conditions providing only functionalities intended to ensure electromagnetic compatibility pursuant to Directive 2004/108/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2);",
  "generated_definition": "'off mode' means a condition in which equipment consumes zero or very low power when connected to the mains power source, typically achieved through the use of power management functions. this mode may also be referred to as standby mode or sleep mode, depending on the specific requirements of the equipment.",
