      "3.   In order to specify the system state, each TSO shall perform contingency analysis at least once every 15 minutes, monitoring the transmission system's parameters defined in accordance with paragraph 2, against the operational security limits defined in accordance with Article 25 and the criteria for system states defined in accordance with Article 18. Each TSO shall also monitor the level of available reserves against the reserve capacity. When carrying out the contingency analysis, each TSO shall take into account the effect of remedial actions and the measures of the system defence plan.",
