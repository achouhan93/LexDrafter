      "The scope of this Regulation should include boiler space heaters, cogeneration space heaters and heat pump space heaters providing heat to water-based central heating systems for space heating purposes, and boiler combination heaters and heat pump combination heaters providing heat to water-based central heating systems for space heating purposes and heat to deliver hot drinking and sanitary water. These heaters are designed to use gaseous or liquid fuels, including from biomass (unless predominantly), electricity and ambient or waste heat.",
      "In the Union there are almost five million dwellings with shared open-flue systems. For technical reasons it is not possible to replace existing boiler space heaters and boiler combination heaters by efficient condensing boilers in dwellings with a shared open-flue system. The requirements contained in this Regulation allow non-condensing boilers specifically designed for such a configuration to remain on the market; this is to prevent undue costs for consumers, to give manufacturers time to develop boilers dedicated to more efficient heating technologies, and to give Member States time to reflect on national building codes.",
