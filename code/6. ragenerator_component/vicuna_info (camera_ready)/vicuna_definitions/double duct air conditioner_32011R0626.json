      "Technological developments in the energy efficiency improvement of air conditioners have been very rapid in recent years. This has allowed several third-countries to introduce stringent minimum energy efficiency requirements and led to a process of introducing new energy labelling schemes based on seasonal performance. Today's appliances, excluding single and double duct air conditioners, that achieve the highest efficiency levels have largely surpassed the A efficiency levels established by Directive 2002/31/EC.",
      "This Regulation introduces two energy efficiency scales based on the primary function and on specific aspects important to consumer. Given that air conditioners are used mainly in part-load conditions, the efficiency testing should be changed to a seasonal efficiency measurement method, except for single and double duct air conditioners. The seasonal measurement method takes better into account the benefits of the inverter driven technology and the conditions in which these appliances are used. The new efficiency calculation method with an Ecodesign implementing measure setting minimum energy efficiency requirements higher than the current A level, will lead to a reclassification of these appliances. Consequently, split, window and wall air conditioners should have a new A-G energy efficiency class scale with a \u2018+\u2019 added on the top of the scale every two years until the A+++ class has been reached.",

      "For double duct and single duct air conditioners, steady-state energy efficiency performance indicators should continue to be applied, as there are currently no inverter units on the market. As no reclassification of these appliances is appropriate, single and double duct air conditioners should have an A+++-D scale. While these, inherently less efficient than split appliances, can go only up to an A+ energy efficiency class in a scale of A+++-D, the more efficient split appliances can reach up to the A+++ energy efficiency class.",
