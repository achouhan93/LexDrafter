  "original_definition": "'energy efficiency first' means taking utmost account in energy planning, and in policy and investment decisions, of alternative cost-efficient energy efficiency measures to make energy demand and energy supply more efficient, in particular by means of cost-effective end-use energy savings, demand response initiatives and more efficient conversion, transmission and distribution of energy, whilst still achieving the objectives of those decisions;",
  "generated_definition": "'energy efficiency first' means the principle that energy efficiency should be given priority in policies and measures to promote sustainable development and reduce energy consumption.",

      "Parallel to this Regulation, the Commission has developed and adopted a series of initiatives in sectoral energy policy, in particular with regard torenewable energy,energy efficiency, including on the energy performance ofbuildings, and market design. Those initiatives form a package under the overarching theme ofenergy efficiency first, the Union's global leadership in renewables, and a fair deal for energy consumers, including by addressing energy poverty and promoting fair competition in the internal market.",

      "Member States should use the energy efficiency first principle, which means to consider, before taking energy planning, policy and investment decisions, whether cost-efficient, technically, economically and environmentally sound alternative energy efficiency measures could replace in whole or in part the envisaged planning, policy and investment measures, whilst still achieving the objectives of the respective decisions. This includes, in particular, the treatment of energy efficiency as a crucial element and a key consideration in future investment decisions on energy infrastructure in the Union. Such cost-efficient alternatives include measures to make energy demand and energy supply more efficient, in particular by means of cost-effective end-use energy savings, demand response initiatives and more efficient conversion, transmission and distribution of energy. Member States should also encourage the spread of that principle in regional and local government, as well as in the private sector.",
