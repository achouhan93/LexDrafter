Their energy consumption in the use phase is the most significant environmental aspect of all life-cycle phases, with their annual electricity consumption amounting to 109 TWh in 2005, corresponding to 50 Mt in CO2 emissions. In the absence of measures to limit this consumption, it is predicted that energy consumption will increase to 136 TWh in 2020.

There is a total cost-effective potential for improving the energy efficiency of these pumping systems by approximately 20 % to 30 %.
