A three-step logic applies to investments in projects of common interest. First, the market should have the priority to invest. Second, if investments are not made by the market, regulatory solutions should be explored, if necessary the relevant regulatory framework should be adjusted, and the correct application of the relevant regulatory framework should be ensured. Third, where the first two steps are not sufficient to deliver the necessary investments in projects of common interest, Union financial assistance could be granted if theproject of common interest fulfils the applicable eligibility criteria.",
      "Projects of common interest should comply with common, transparent and objective criteria in view of their contribution to the energy policy objectives. For electricity and gas, in order to be eligible for inclusion in the second and subsequent Union lists, projects should be part of the latest available 10-year network development plan. This plan should notably take account of the conclusions of the European Council of 4 February 2011 with regard to the need to integrate peripheral energy markets.",
      "In order to ensure that the Union list ofprojects of common interest (\u2018Union list\u2019) is limited to projects which contribute the most to the implementation of the strategicenergy infrastructure priority corridors and areas, the power to adopt and review the Union list should be delegated to the Commission in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU, while respecting the right of the Member States to approve projects of common interest related to their territory. According to analysis carried out in the impact assessment accompanying the proposal that has led to this Regulation, the number of such projects is estimated at some 100 in the field of electricity and 50 in the field of gas. Taking into account this estimate, and the need to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation, the total number of projects of common interest should remain manageable, and therefore should not significantly exceed 220. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure the simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.",
      "In an increasingly integrated internal energy market, clear and transparent rules for cost allocation across borders are necessary in order to accelerate investment in cross-border infrastructure. The European Council of 4 February 2011 recalled the importance of promoting a regulatory framework attractive to investment in networks, with tariffs set at levels consistent with financing needs and the appropriate cost allocation for cross-border investments, while enhancing competition and competitiveness and taking account of the impact on consumers. When deciding on cross-border cost allocation, national regulatory authorities should ensure that its impact on national tariffs does not represent a disproportionate burden for consumers. The national regulatory authorities should also avoid the risks of double support forprojects by taking into account actual or estimated charges and revenues. Those charges and revenues should be taken into account only insofar as they are designed to cover the costs concerned and as much as possible related to the projects. When an investment request takes into account benefits beyond the borders of the Member States concerned, the national regulatory authorities should consult the TSOs concerned on the project-specific cost-benefit analysis.",
      "Projects of common interest should be implemented as quickly as possible and should be closely monitored and evaluated, while keeping the administrative burden forproject promoters to a minimum. The Commission should nominate European coordinators for projects facing particular difficulties.",
      "This Regulation applies only to the granting of permits for, public participation in, and the regulatory treatment of projects of common interest within the meaning set out herein. Member States may nevertheless apply, by virtue of their national law, the same or similar rules to other projects which do not have the status of projects of common interest within the scope of this Regulation. As regards the regulatory incentives, Member States may apply, by virtue of their national law, the same or similar rules to projects of common interest falling under the category of electricity storage.",
      "A new Union list should be established every two years. Projects of common interest that are completed or that no longer fulfil the relevant criteria and requirements as set out in this Regulation should not appear on the next Union list. For that reason, existing projects of common interest that are to be included in the next Union list should be subject to the same selection process for the establishment of regional lists and for the establishment of the Union list as proposed projects; however, care should be taken to minimise the resulting administrative burden as much as possible, for example by using to the extent possible information submitted previously, and by taking account of the annual reports of the project promoters.",
      "The basis for the discussion on the appropriate allocation of costs should be the analysis of the costs and benefits of an infrastructure project on the basis of a harmonised methodology for energy-system-wide analysis, in the framework of the 10-year network development plans prepared by the European Networks of Transmission System Operators under Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks (18), and reviewed by the Agency. That analysis could take into consideration indicators and corresponding reference values for the comparison of unit investment costs.",
      "Member States that currently do not provide for a legal status of the highest national significance possible that is attributable to energy infrastructure projects in the context of permit granting processes should consider introducing such a status, in particular by evaluating if this would lead to a quicker permit granting process.",
      "Evaluation of the current TEN-E framework has clearly shown that this framework, while making a positive contribution to selected projects by giving them political visibility, lacks vision, focus, and flexibility to fill identified infrastructure gaps. The Union should therefore increase its efforts to meet future challenges in this field, and due attention should be paid to identifying potential future gaps in energy demand and supply.",
      "The correct and coordinated implementation of Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (15), of Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (16), where applicable, of the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters, signed in Aarhus on 25 June 1998 (17) (the \u2018Aarhus Convention\u2019), and of the Espoo Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context (the \u2018Espoo Convention\u2019) should ensure the harmonisation of the main principles for the assessment of environmental effects, including in a cross-border context. Member States should coordinate their assessments for projects of common interest, and provide for joint assessments, where possible. Member States should be encouraged to exchange best practice and administrative capacity-building for permit granting processes.",
      "Projects of common interest should be implemented as quickly as possible and should be closely monitored and evaluated, while keeping the administrative burden for project promoters to a minimum. The Commission should nominate European coordinators for projects facing particular difficulties.",
      "Where Member States consider it appropriate, they may include in the comprehensive decision decisions taken in the context of: negotiations with individual landowners to granting access to, ownership of, or a right to occupy property; spatial planning which determines the general land use of a defined region, includes other developments such as highways, railways, buildings and nature protection areas, and is not undertaken for the specific purpose of the planned project; granting of operational permits. In the context of the permit granting processes, a project of common interest could include related infrastructure to the extent that it is essential for the construction or functioning of the project.",
      "Projects of common interest in the fields of electricity, gas and carbon dioxide should be eligible to receive Union financial assistance for studies and, under certain conditions, for works as soon as such funding becomes available under the relevant Regulation on a Connecting Europe Facility in the form of grants or in the form of innovative financial instruments. This will ensure that tailor-made support can be provided to those projects of common interest which are not viable under the existing regulatory framework and market conditions. It is important to avoid any distortion of competition, in particular between projects contributing to the achievement of the same Union priority corridor.

      "It is important to streamline and improve permit granting processes, while respecting \u2014 to the extent possible with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity \u2014 national competences and procedures for the construction of new infrastructure. Given the urgency of developing energy infrastructures, the simplification of permit granting processes should be accompanied by a clear time-limit for the decision to be taken by the respective authorities regarding the construction of the project. That time limit should stimulate a more efficient definition and handling of procedures, and should under no circumstances compromise the high standards for the protection of the environment and public participation. With regard to the maximum time limits established by this Regulation, Member States could nevertheless strive to further shorten them if feasible. The competent authorities should ensure compliance with the time limits, and Member States should endeavour to ensure that appeals challenging the substantive or procedural legality of a comprehensive decision are handled in the most efficient way possible.",
      "Regional groups should be established for the purpose of proposing and reviewing projects of common interest, leading to the establishment of regional lists of projects of common interest. In order to ensure broad consensus, these regional groups should ensure close cooperation between Member States, national regulatory authorities, project promoters and relevant stakeholders. The cooperation should rely as much as possible on existing regional cooperation structures of national regulatory authorities and TSOs and other structures established by the Member States and the Commission. In the context of this cooperation, national regulatory authorities should, when necessary, advise the regional groups, inter alia on the feasibility of the regulatory aspects of proposed projects and on the feasibility of the proposed timetable for regulatory approval.",
      "Despite the existence of established standards for the participation of the public in environmental decision-making procedures, additional measures are needed to ensure the highest possible standards of transparency and public participation for all relevant issues in the permit granting process for projects of common interest.",
      "The costs for the development, construction, operation and maintenance of projects of common interest should in general be fully borne by the users of the infrastructure. Projects of common interest should be eligible for cross-border cost allocation when an assessment of market demand or of the expected effects on the tariffs have indicated that costs cannot be expected to be recovered by the tariffs paid by the infrastructure users.",
      "The planning and implementation of Unionprojects of common interest in the areas of energy, transport and telecommunication infrastructure should be coordinated to generate synergies whenever to do so makes sense from an overall economic, technical, environmental or spatial planning point of view and with due regard to the relevant safety aspects. Thus, when the various European networks are being planned, preference could be given to integrating transport, communication and energy networks in order to ensure that as little land as possible is taken up, whilst ensuring, where possible, that existing or disused routes are reused, in order to reduce to a minimum any negative social, economic, environmental and financial impact.",

      "The existing internal energy market law requires that tariffs for access to gas and electricity networks provide appropriate incentives for investment. When applying the internal energy market law, national regulatory authorities should ensure a stable and predictable regulatory framework with incentives for projects of common interest, including long-term incentives, that are commensurate with the level of specific risk of the project. This applies in particular to innovative transmission technologies for electricity allowing for large scale integration of renewable energy, of distributed energy resources or of demand response in interconnected networks, and to gas transmission infrastructure offering advanced capacity or additional flexibility to the market to allow for short-term trading or back-up supply in case of supply disruptions.",
      "The European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR), established by Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (19) has demonstrated the added value of leveraging private funding through significant Union financial assistance to allow the implementation of projects of European significance. The European Council of 4 February 2011 recognised that some energy infrastructure projects may require limited public finance to leverage private funding. In the light of the economic and financial crisis and budgetary constraints, targeted support, through grants and financial instruments, should be developed under the next multiannual financial framework, which will attract new investors into the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas, while keeping the budgetary contribution of the Union to a minimum. The relevant measures should draw on the experience gained during the pilot phase following the introduction of project bonds to finance infrastructure projects.",
