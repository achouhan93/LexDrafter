Such assignment should be limited to tasks and obligations executed at national level (such as imbalance settlement). The limitations to the assignment should not lead to unnecessary changes to the existing national arrangements. However TSOs should remain responsible for the tasks entrusted to them pursuant to Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) for the development of European-wide methodologies, as well as the implementation and operation of the European-wide balancing platforms. Where, in a Member State, the expertise and experience of operating imbalance settlement lies with a third party, the TSO of the Member State may request the other TSOs and ENTSO-E to enable such third party to assist in the development of the proposal. However, the responsibility for developing the proposal remains with the TSO of the Member State in conjunction with all other TSOs and such responsibility cannot be transferred to a third party.",

      "Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 sets out non-discriminatory rules on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and, in particular, rules on capacity allocation for interconnections and transmission systems affecting cross-border electricity flows. In order to move towards a genuinely integrated electricity market and to ensure operational security, efficient balancing rules should be developed in order to provide incentives for market participants to contribute to solving the system scarcities for which they are responsible. In particular, it is necessary to set up rules related to the technical and operational aspects of system balancing and to energy trading. Such rules should include system-related power reserve rules."
