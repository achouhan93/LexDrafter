      "TSOs should be able to delegate all or part of any tasks under this Regulation to a third party. The delegating TSO should remain responsible for ensuring compliance with the obligations in this Regulation. Likewise Member States should be able to assign tasks and obligations under this Regulation to a third party. Such assignment should be limited to tasks and obligations executed at national level (such as imbalance settlement). The limitations to the assignment should not lead to unnecessary changes to the existing national arrangements. However TSOs should remain responsible for the tasks entrusted to them pursuant to Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) for the development of European-wide methodologies, as well as the implementation and operation of the European-wide balancing platforms. Where, in a Member State, the expertise and experience of operating imbalance settlement lies with a third party, the TSO of the Member State may request the other TSOs and ENTSO-E to enable such third party to assist in the development of the proposal. However, the responsibility for developing the proposal remains with the TSO of the Member State in conjunction with all other TSOs and such responsibility cannot be transferred to a third party.",
