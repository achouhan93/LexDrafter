The decommissioning plan is prepared by the nuclear facility licence holder and is reflected in the multiannual work programmes of the Programme;",
  "generated_definition": "'decommissioning plan' means a plan for the safe management of the decommissioning and radioactive waste in line with the needs identified in the respective decommissioning plan and of activated materials and dismantling materials, including their decontamination up to interim storage or to disposal (depending on the waste category), as well as the completion of the waste and material management infrastructure where necessary. this objective has to be accomplished in accordance with the decommissioning plan and subject to the necessary management of radioactive waste. progress made in respect of this objective is to be measured by the quantity and type of material released from regulatory control and waste safely stored or disposed as well as earned value.",
