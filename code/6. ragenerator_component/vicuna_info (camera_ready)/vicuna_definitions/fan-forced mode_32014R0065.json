      "The energy consumption of a cavity of a domestic oven shall be measured for one standardised cycle, in a conventional mode and in a fan-forced mode, if available, by heating a standardised load soaked with water. It shall be verified that the temperature inside the oven cavity reaches the temperature setting of the thermostat and/or the oven control display within the duration of the test cycle. The energy consumption per cycle corresponding to the best performing mode (conventional mode or fan-forced mode) shall be used in the following calculations.",
