      "The type and source of reportable data can influence the resources and time the reporting parties need to invest in preparing for data submission. For example completing procedures for reportingstandard contracts executed atorganised market places takes less time than setting up systems for reportingnon-standard contracts or certainfundamental data. To this end the obligation for reporting should be phased in, starting with transmitting fundamental data available on the transparency platforms of ENTSO for Electricity and of ENTSO for Gas as well as standard contracts executed at organised market places. Reporting of non-standard contracts should follow reflecting the extra time needed for completing procedures for reporting. Staggered data reporting would also help the Agency to better allocate its resources to prepare for receiving the information.",
