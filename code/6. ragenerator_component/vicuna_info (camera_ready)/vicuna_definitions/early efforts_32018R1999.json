      "Should the ambition of integrated national energy and climate plans or their updates be insufficient for the collective achievement of the Energy Union objectives and, for the first period, in particular the 2030 targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, the Commission should take measures at Union level in order to ensure the collective achievement of those objectives and targets (thereby closing any \u2018ambition gap\u2019). Should progress made by the Union towards those objectives and targets be insufficient for their delivery, the Commission should, in addition to issuing recommendations, propose measures and exercise its powers at Union level or Member States should take additional measures in order to ensure achievement of these objectives and targets (thereby closing any \u2018delivery gap\u2019). Such measures should also take into account early efforts made by Member States towards the 2030 target for renewable energy by reaching in or before 2020 a share of energy from renewable sources above its national binding target, or by making early progress towards its national binding 2020 target or in the implementation of its contribution to the Union's binding target of at least 32 % of renewable energy in 2030. In the area of renewable energy, such measures can also include voluntary financial contributions by Member States to a Union renewable energy financing mechanism managed by the Commission, which would be used to contribute to the most cost-efficient renewable energy projects across the Union, thus providing the Member States with the option to contribute to the Union target achievement at the lowest possible cost. Member States' national renewable energy targets for 2020 should serve as baseline shares of renewable energy from 2021 onwards and should be maintained throughout the period. In the area of energy efficiency, additional measures can, in particular, aim to improve the energy efficiency of products, buildings and transport.",
