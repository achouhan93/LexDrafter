  "original_definition": "'tube local space heater' means a local space heater, using gaseous or liquid fuel, which is equipped with a burner; which is to be installed above head level, near the subjects to be heated, which heats the space primarily by infrared radiation from the tube or tubes heated by the internal passage of products of combustion and of which the products of combustion are to be evacuated through a flue duct;",
  "generated_definition": "'tube local space heater' means a type of local space heater that uses a tube for heating and has a declared value for emissions of nox. the emissions of nox by this type of heater shall not exceed 200 mg/kwhinput based on gcv and the average seasonal space heating energy efficiency shall not be more than 10% lower than the declared value.",
