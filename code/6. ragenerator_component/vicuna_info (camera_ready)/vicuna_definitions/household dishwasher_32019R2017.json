They are subject to other regulatory work, in particular Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), and should not be included in the scope of this Regulation. This Regulation for household dishwashers should apply to dishwashers with the same technical characteristics, regardless of the setting they are used in.",
      "It appears from the review that the electricity and water consumption of household dishwashers can be further reduced by implementing energy labelling measures focusing on better differentiating between products. This should give suppliers an incentive to further improve the energy and resource efficiency of household dishwashers while accelerating the market transformation towards more efficient technologies.",
      "Household dishwashers that are displayed at trade fairs should bear the energy label if the first unit of the model has already been placed on the market or is placed on the market on the trade fair.",
      "The energy labelling of household dishwashers enable consumers to make informed choices towards more energy and resource efficient appliances. The understanding and relevance of the information provided on the label have been confirmed through a specific consumer survey in line with Article 14(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369.",

      "The review concluded that there was a need to introduce revised energy labelling requirements for household dishwashers.",
      "The environmental aspects of household dishwashers that have been identified as significant for the purposes of this Regulation are energy and water consumption in the use phase, the generation of waste at the end of life, the emissions to air and water in the production phase due to the extraction and processing of raw materials and in the use phase because of the consumption of electricity.",

      "Measures from the ecodesign working plan have an estimated potential to deliver in total more than 260 TWh of annual final energy savings in 2030, which is equivalent to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 100 million tonnes per year in 2030. Household dishwashers is one of the product groups listed in the working plan, with estimated annual electricity savings of 2,1 TWh, leading to GHG emission reductions of 0,7 Mt CO2 eq/year, and estimated water savings of 16 million m3 in 2030."
