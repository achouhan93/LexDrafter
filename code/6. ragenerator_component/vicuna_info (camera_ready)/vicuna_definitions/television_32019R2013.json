      "The Commission has reviewed Regulation (EU) No 1062/2010 as required by its Article 7 and analysed technical, environmental and economic aspects of televisions and other electronic displays, including monitors and signage displays as well as the real-life user understanding and behaviour in respect to different labelling elements. The review was carried out in close cooperation with stakeholders and interested parties from the Union and third countries. The results of the review were made public and presented to the Consultation Forum established by Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1369.",

      "It appears from the review that the same requirements for televisions should also apply to monitors because of the rapidly increasing functionality overlap between displays and televisions. Moreover, digital signage displays are specifically listed in the Commission's 2016-2019 ecodesign working plan to be taken up in the revision of the existing regulations for televisions. The scope of this Regulation should thus comprise electronic displays including televisions, monitors and digital signage displays.",
