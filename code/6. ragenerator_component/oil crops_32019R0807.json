      "The report on feedstock expansion also highlights that the impact of the expansion of the production area ofoil cropsintoland with high-carbon stock on the potential of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels to achieve greenhouse gas emission savings depends on several factors. Among those, the absolute and relative magnitude of the land expansion since a specific reference year compared to the total production area of the relevant crop, the share of this expansion into land with high-carbon stock as well as the type of high-carbon stock area, play a crucial role in determining the significance of such expansion for the purposes of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. These factors, as well as the specific productivity factors for each group of crop, should therefore be taken into account when laying down the criteria for determining the high ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops for which a significant expansion of the feedstock production area into land with high-carbon stock is observed.",

      "Scientific literature also demonstrates that the impact of ILUC on the potential of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels to achieve greenhouse gas emission savings is particularly pronounced for oil crops. Renewable fuels made from such feedstocks are therefore widely considered as having a higher ILUC-risk. This is reflected in Annex VIII, Part A of both Directive 2009/28/EC and Directive (EU) 2018/2001. The report on feedstock expansion, reflecting the latest best available scientific data on the worldwide expansion of the production area of food and feed crops into land with high carbon stock, confirms that these crops are also responsible for an overwhelming majority of the observed worldwide expansion of the production area of food and feed crops into land with high-carbon stock.",

      "Directive (EU) 2015/1513 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) not only acknowledged the existence of ILUC emissions, but also recognised, despite the uncertainty in calculating them, that the magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions linked to ILUC can lead to negating some or all of the greenhouse gas emissions savings of individual biofuels, as defined in that Directive, and bioliquids. Therefore, it introduced an overall limit to the amount of those fuels produced from cereal and other starch-rich crops, sugars and oil crops and from crops grown as main crops primarily for energy purposes on agricultural land that can be counted towards targets set out in Directive 2009/28/EC. That limit consists of a 7 % maximum contribution of such fuels towards the final consumption of energy in rail and road transport in each Member State."
