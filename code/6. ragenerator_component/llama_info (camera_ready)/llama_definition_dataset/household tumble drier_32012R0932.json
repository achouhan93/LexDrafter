The annual electricity consumption of household tumble driers is estimated to have been 21 TWh in the European Union in 2005. Unless specific measures are taken, annual electricity consumption is predicted to be 31 TWh in 2020. The preparatory study shows that the energy consumption of products subject to this Regulation can be significantly reduced.",

In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 2009/125/EC, Member States shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market and/or putting into service, within their territories, of household tumble driers on grounds of ecodesign requirements relating to those ecodesign parameters referred to in Annex I, Part 1, of that Directive for which this Regulation provides that no ecodesign requirement is necessary.",
