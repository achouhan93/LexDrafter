      "The report on feedstock expansion also highlights that the impact of the expansion of the production area ofoil cropsintoland with high-carbon stock on the potential of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels to achieve greenhouse gas emission savings depends on several factors. Among those, the absolute and relative magnitude of the land expansion since a specific reference year compared to the total production area of the relevant crop, the share of this expansion into land with high-carbon stock as well as the type of high-carbon stock area, play a crucial role in determining the significance of such expansion for the purposes of Directive (EU) 2018/2001. These factors, as well as the specific productivity factors for each group of crop, should therefore be taken into account when laying down the criteria for determining the high ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops for which a significant expansion of the feedstock production area into land with high-carbon stock is observed.",
      "Scientific literature also demonstrates that the impact of ILUC on the potential of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels to achieve greenhouse gas emission savings is particularly pronounced for oil crops. Renewable fuels made from such feedstocks are therefore widely considered as having a higher ILUC-risk. This is reflected in Annex VIII, Part A of both Directive 2009/28/EC and Directive (EU) 2018/2001. The report on feedstock expansion, reflecting the latest best available scientific data on the worldwide expansion of the production area of food and feed crops into land with high carbon stock, confirms that these crops are also responsible for an overwhelming majority of the observed worldwide expansion of the production area of food and feed crops into land with high-carbon stock.",
      "In accordance with Article 26(2) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, Member States are required to apply the criteria set out in this Regulation for determining the high indirect land-use change-risk feedstock for which a significant expansion of the production area into land with high-carbon stock is observed. They should do so on the basis of the information included in an annex, to be revised in accordance with this Regulation. The Commission should review the report on feedstock expansion regularly, to take into account the evolving circumstances and the latest available scientific evidence. The annex should be amended where appropriate.",

      "While it is widely acknowledged that there are risks arising from ILUC related to the use of food and feed crops for the production of fuels, scientific literature shows that the level of ILUC emissions depends on a variety of factors, including the type of feedstock used for the renewable fuel production, the level of additional demand for feedstock triggered by the use of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels, and the extent to which land with high-carbon stock is protected worldwide."
