Given that air conditioners are used mainly in part-load conditions, the efficiency testing should be changed to a seasonal efficiency measurement method, except for single and double duct air conditioners. The seasonal measurement method takes better into account the benefits of the inverter driven technology and the conditions in which these appliances are used. The new efficiency calculation method with an Ecodesign implementing measure setting minimum energy efficiency requirements higher than the current A level, will lead to a reclassification of these appliances. Consequently, split, window and wall air conditioners should have a new A-G energy efficiency class scale with a \u2018+\u2019 added on the top of the scale every two years until the A+++ class has been reached.",
