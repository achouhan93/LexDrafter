For this purpose, they should establish acommon grid model including estimates on generation, load and network status for each hour. The available capacity should normally be calculated according to the so-called flow-based calculation method, a method that takes into account that electricity can flow via different paths and optimises the available capacity in highly interdependent grids. The available cross-border capacity should be one of the key inputs into the further calculation process, in which all Union bids and offers, collected by power exchanges, are matched, taking into account available cross-border capacity in an economically optimal manner. Single day-ahead and intraday coupling ensures that power usually flows from low- price to high- price areas.",
