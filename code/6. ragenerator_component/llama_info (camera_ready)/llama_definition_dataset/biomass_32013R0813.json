      "Heaters that are designed for using gaseous or liquid fuels predominantly (more than 50 %) produced frombiomass have specific technical characteristics which require further technical, economic and environmental analyses. Depending on the outcome of the analyses, ecodesign requirements for those heaters should be set at a later stage, if appropriate.",
      "The scope of this Regulation should include boiler space heaters, cogeneration space heaters and heat pump space heaters providing heat to water-based central heating systems for space heating purposes, and boiler combination heaters and heat pump combination heaters providing heat to water-based central heating systems for space heating purposes and heat to deliver hot drinking and sanitary water. These heaters are designed to use gaseous or liquid fuels, including from biomass (unless predominantly), electricity and ambient or waste heat.",
