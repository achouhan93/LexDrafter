      "Effective monitoring and control of the evolution of the decommissioning process should be ensured by Bulgaria, Slovakia and the Commission in order to assure the highest EU added value of the funding allocated under this Regulation, although the ultimate responsibility for the decommissioning rests with the two Member States concerned. This includes effective measurement of progress and performance, and the enacting of corrective measures where necessary. To that end, a committee with monitoring and information functions should be established and co-chaired by a representative of the Commission and of the Member State concerned. Similarly, a group of independent experts from the Member States appointed by the Commission assists the JRC decommissioning and waste management programme.",
