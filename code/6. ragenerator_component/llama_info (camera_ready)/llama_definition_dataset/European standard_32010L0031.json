      "The comparative methodology framework shall allow for taking into account use patterns, outdoor climate conditions, investment costs, building category, maintenance and operating costs (including energy costs and savings), earnings from energy produced, where applicable, and disposal costs, where applicable.

      "The energy performance of buildings should be calculated on the basis of a methodology, which may be differentiated at national and regional level. That includes, in addition to thermal characteristics, other factors that play an increasingly important role such as heating and air-conditioning installations, application of energy from renewable sources, passive heating and cooling elements, shading, indoor air-quality, adequate natural light and design of the building. The methodology for calculating energy performance should be based not only on the season in which heating is required, but should cover the annual energy performance of a building. That methodology should take into account existing European standards.",
