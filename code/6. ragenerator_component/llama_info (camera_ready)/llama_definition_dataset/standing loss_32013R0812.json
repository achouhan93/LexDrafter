      "The energy consumed by water heaters and hot water storage tanks accounts for a significant share of the total energy demand in the Union, and water heaters and hot water storage tanks with equivalent functionality exhibit a wide disparity in terms of water heating energy efficiency and standing loss. The scope for reducing their energy consumption is significant and includes combining water heaters with appropriate solar devices. Water heaters, hot water storage tanks and packages of water heaters and solar devices should therefore be covered by energy labelling requirements.",
