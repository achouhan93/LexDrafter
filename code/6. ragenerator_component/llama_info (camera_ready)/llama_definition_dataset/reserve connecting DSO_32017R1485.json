      "One of the most critical processes in ensuring operational security with a high level of reliability and quality is the load-frequency control (\u2018LFC\u2019). Effective LFC can be made possible only if there is an obligation for the TSOs and the reserve connecting DSOs to cooperate for the operation of the interconnected transmission systems as one entity and for providers' power generating modules and providers' demand facilities to meet the relevant minimum technical requirements.",
      "The provisions on LFC and reserves, aim at setting out clear, objective and harmonised requirements for TSOs, reserve connecting DSOs, providers' power generating modules and providers' demand facilities in order to ensure system security and to contribute to non-discrimination, effective competition and the efficient functioning of the internal electricity market. The provisions on LFC and reserves provide the technical framework necessary for the development of cross-border balancing markets.",
