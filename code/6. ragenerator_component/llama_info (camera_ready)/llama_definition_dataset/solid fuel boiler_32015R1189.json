The annual energy consumption related to solid fuel boilers is expected to be 530 petajoules (\u2018PJ\u2019) (approximately 12,7 million tonnes of oil equivalent \u2018Mtoe\u2019) in 2030 and annual emissions are expected to be 25 kilotonnes (\u2018kt\u2019) of particulate matter, 25 kt of organic gaseous compounds and 292 kt of carbon monoxide in 2030. Emissions of nitrogen oxides are expected to increase because of potential new solid fuel boiler designs aiming at higher energy efficiency and lower organic emissions. The preparatory study shows that use-phase energy consumption and emissions by solid fuel boilers can be significantly reduced."
