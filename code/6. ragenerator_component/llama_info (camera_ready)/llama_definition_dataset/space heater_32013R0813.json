      "Directive 92/42/EEC should be repealed, except for Articles 7(2) and 8 thereof and Annexes III to V thereto, and new provisions should be laid down by this Regulation to ensure that the scope is extended to heaters other than boilers, to further improve the energy efficiency of space heaters and combination heaters, and to improve other significant environmental aspects of space heaters and combination heaters.",
      "Ecodesign requirements should harmonise energy consumption, sound power level and nitrogen oxides emission requirements for space heaters and combination heaters throughout the Union, thus helping to make the internal market operate better and to improve the environmental performance of these products.",
      "Annual energy consumption related tospace heaters andcombination heaters was estimated to have been 12 089 PJ (about 289 Mtoe) in the Union in 2005, corresponding to 698 Mt CO2 emissions. Unless specific measures are taken, annual energy consumption is expected to be 10 688 PJ in 2020. Annual emissions of nitrogen oxides related to space heaters and combination heaters were estimated to have been 821 kt SOx equivalent in the Union in 2005. Unless specific measures are taken, annual emissions are expected to be 783 kt SOx equivalent in 2020. The preparatory study shows that the use-phase energy consumption and emissions of nitrogen oxides of space heaters and combination heaters can be significantly reduced.",
      "The energy consumption of space heaters and combination heaters can be reduced by applying existing cost-effective non-proprietary technologies which lead to a reduction in the combined costs of purchasing and operating these products.",

In addition, for heaters usingfossil fuels, emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and hydrocarbons are identified as significant environmental aspects.",
