      "The Commission has carried out a preparatory study to analyse the technical, environmental and economic aspects ofmobile phones, cordless phones and slate tablets. The study has been carried out with stakeholders and interested parties from the Union and third countries, and the results have been made publicly available.",
      "The total primary energy consumption of the installed base in the EU27 of mobile phones, cordless phones and slate tablets in 2020 over their lifecycle was 39,5 TWh (of which 28,5 TWh for smartphones, 1,6 TWh for mobile phones other than smartphones, 1,8 TWh for cordless phones and 7,6 TWh for slate tablets), which includes a major share of primary energy consumption in production outside the EU27. Of these 39,5 TWh, the share attributed to electricity consumption - for both production and use - is 26,6 TWh (19,2 TWh, 0,9 TWh, 1,1 TWh and 5,4 TWh, respectively, for smartphones, mobile phones other than smartphones, cordless phones and slate tablets). Without regulatory measures, those values are projected to decrease slightly to 39,3 TWh (29,3 TWh, 1,5 TWh, 1,4TWh and 7,3TWh, respectively, for smartphones, mobile phones other than smartphones, cordless phones and slate tablets) of primary energy in 2030. The combined effect of this Regulation and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1669 (2) is expected to limit this 2030 value to 25,4 TWh (18,2 TWh, 1,0 TWh, 1,1TWh and 5,2 TWh, respectively, for smartphones, mobile phones other than smartphones, cordless phones and slate tablets), saving around 33 % on the primary energy consumption of smartphones, mobile phones other than smartphones, cordless phones and slate tablets compared to what would happen if no measures were taken.",
