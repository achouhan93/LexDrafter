      "Furthermore, it is appropriate not to apply the financial additionality criterion to theadditional feedstockcultivated on abandoned orseverely degraded land or by independent small farm holders. This would in fact amount to an unreasonable administrative burden in light of the significant potential for productivity improvements and the barriers faced to finance the necessary investments. Therefore, measures taken on abandoned or severely degraded land or by independent small farm holders should be exempted from proving compliance with the financial additionality criteria, without prejudice to the requirement of producing additional feedstock and complying with the sustainability criteria. In light of the statistical work carried out in several analyses, including the FAO smallholders data-portrait, holdings below 2 hectares should be considered small in this context.",
      "As a further guarantee of the positive effects of low ILUC-risk certification, the additional feedstock to be used for low ILUC-risk fuels should be taken into account only if resulting from a limited category of measures. In particular, only measures that are financially attractive because they allow to reap the financial premium arising from such certification should be considered, in analogy with the financial additionality criteria applied under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol.",
