      "Ecodesign requirements should harmonise electricity consumption requirements for circulators throughout the Community, thus contributing to the functioning of the internal market and to improving the environmental performance of these products.",
      "The Commission has carried out a preparatory study to analyse the technical, environmental and economic aspects of circulators typically used in buildings. The study has been developed together with stakeholders and interested parties from the Community and third countries, and the results have been made publicly available.",
      "The environmental aspect of circulators that is identified as significant for the purposes of this Regulation is electricity consumption in the use phase.",
      "The ecodesign requirements should not have a negative impact on the functionality of circulators and should not negatively affect health, safety or the environment. In particular, the benefits of reducing electricity consumption during the use phase should more than offset any additional environmental impacts during the production phase.",
      "To increase the re-use and recycling of circulators, manufacturers should provide information on the assembly and dismantling of circulators.",
      "Circulators should be made more efficient by applying existing non-proprietary cost-effective technologies that can reduce the total combined costs of purchasing and operating circulators.",
      "This Regulation should quickly ensure the placing on the market of technologies that reduce the life-cycle environmental impact of circulators, leading to estimated electricity savings of 23 TWh by 2020, corresponding to 11 Mt of CO2 equivalent, compared with the situation, where no action is taken.",
      "Circulators consume much of the energy used in heating systems in buildings. Furthermore, most standard circulators operate continuously, regardless of heating needs. Circulators are therefore one of the priority products for which ecodesign requirements should be established.",
      "The preparatory study shows that requirements regarding other ecodesign parameters referred to in Annex I, Part 1, of Directive 2005/32/EC are not necessary as power consumption of circulators in use phase is by far the most important environmental aspect.",
      "The ecodesign requirements should be introduced gradually in order to provide a sufficient timeframe for manufacturers to re-design products subject to this Regulation as appropriate. The timing for the introduction of these requirements should be such as to avoid negative impacts on the functionalities of circulators on the market, and to take into account cost impacts for manufacturers, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, while ensuring timely achievement of the objectives of the Regulation.",
      "The ecodesign requirements should not have a negative impact on the functionality ofcirculators and should not negatively affect health, safety or the environment. In particular, the benefits of reducing electricity consumption during the use phase should more than offset any additional environmental impacts during theproduction phase.",

The timing for the introduction of these requirements should be such as to avoid negative impacts on the functionalities ofcirculators on the market, and to take into account cost impacts for manufacturers, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, while ensuring timely achievement of the objectives of the Regulation.",
      "The preparatory study shows that approximately 14 million circulators are placed on the Community market annually and that their most significant environmental impact out of all life-cycle phases is the use phase energy consumption amounting to 50 TWh in 2005, corresponding to 23 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. If no specific measures are taken, electricity consumption is predicted to increase to 55 TWh by 2020. The preparatory study shows that use phase electricity consumption can be significantly improved.",
      "In addition to the legally binding requirements laid down in this Regulation, indicative benchmarks for best available technologies should be identified to ensure wide availability and easy accessibility of information on the life-cycle environmental performance of circulators.",
      "Article 16(2), first indent, of Directive 2005/32/EC provides that, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 19(3) and the criteria set out in Article 15(2) of that Directive, and after consulting the Ecodesign Consultation Forum, the Commission will, as appropriate, introduce an implementing measure for appliances in electric motor systems and heating equipment, such as for circulators."
