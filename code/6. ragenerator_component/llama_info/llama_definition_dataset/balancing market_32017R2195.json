      "In order to allow an exchange of balancing services, the creation of common merit order lists and adequate liquidity in the balancing market, it is necessary to regulate the standardisation of balancing products. This Regulation lists the minimum set of standard characteristics and additional characteristics defining standard products.",
      "This Regulation establishes an EU-wide set of technical, operational and market rules to govern the functioning of electricity balancing markets. It sets out rules for the procurement of balancing capacity, the activation of balancing energy and the financial settlement of balance responsible parties. It also requires the development of harmonised methodologies for the allocation of cross-zonal transmission capacity for balancing purposes. Such rules will increase the liquidity of short-term markets by allowing for more cross-border trade and for a more efficient use of the existing grid for the purposes of balancing energy. As balancing energy bids will compete on EU-wide balancing platforms, it will also have positive effects on competition.",
      "The integration of balancing energy markets should facilitate the efficient functioning of the intraday market in order to provide the possibility for market participants to balance themselves as close as possible to real time. Only the imbalances remaining after the end of the intraday market should be balanced by TSOs with the balancing market. The harmonisation of the imbalance settlement period to 15 minutes in Europe should support intraday trading and foster the development of a number of trading products with same delivery windows.",
