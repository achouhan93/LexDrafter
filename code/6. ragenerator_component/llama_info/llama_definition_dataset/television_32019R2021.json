      "Electronic displays other than televisions, with various selectable input sources shall switch, as configured in the normal configuration, into standby mode, networked standby mode or another mode which does not exceed the applicable power demand requirements respectively for standby or networked standby mode when no input is detected by any input source for over 10 seconds and, for digital interactive whiteboards and for broadcast displays, for over 60 minutes.",

      "If the television provides a function allowing the user to shorten, extend or disable the 4-hour period for automatic mode transitions detailed in (a), a warning message shall appear about a potential increase in energy use and a confirmation of the new setting must be requested when an extension beyond the 4-hour period or disabling is selected.",

Member State authorities shall use the applicable procedure to measure the power demand after the automatic power down functionality switches the television into the applicable power mode; and",

Before such automatic switch, televisions shall show, for at least 20 seconds, an alert message warning the user of the impending switch, with possibility of delaying or temporarily cancelling it.",

      "Specific requirements should be laid down for standby, networked standby and off mode electric power demand ofelectronic displays. Therefore, the requirements of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1275/2008 (4) that does not apply totelevisions, should no longer apply to the additional electronic displays types covered by the scope of this Regulation. Regulation (EC) No 1275/2008 should be amended accordingly.",
      "The annual energy consumption in 2016 of televisions in the Union constituted more than 3 % of the European Union\u2019s electricity consumption. The projected energy consumption of televisions, monitors and digital signage displays would be expected be close to 100 TWh/yr in 2030. This Regulation, together with the accompanying energy labelling regulation, is estimated to reduce the overall consumption by 39 TWh/yr by 2030.",
      "The review concluded that there was a need for the introduction of new ecodesign energy-related requirements fortelevisions and that the same requirements should also apply to other displays, such as computer monitors, because of the rapidly increasing functionality overlap between different display types.Projectors use very different technologies and consequently should be out of scope of this Regulation.",
