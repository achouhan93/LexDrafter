      "In its conclusions of 23 and 24 October 2014, the European Council endorsed a 2030 Framework for Energy and Climate for the Union based on four key Union-level targets: a reduction of at least 40 % in economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, an indicative target of improvement in energy efficiency of at least 27 %, to be reviewed by 2020 with a view to increasing the level to 30 %, a share of renewable energy consumed in the Union of at least 27 %, and electricity interconnection of at least 15 %. It specified that the target for renewable energy is binding at Union level and that it will be fulfilled through Member States' contributions guided by the need to deliver collectively the Union target. A recast of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) has introduced a new, binding, renewable energy target for the Union for 2030 of at least 32 %, including a provision for a review with a view to increasing the Union-level target by 2023. Amendments to Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) have set the Union-level target for improvements in energy efficiency in 2030 to at least 32,5 %, including a provision for a review with a view to increasing the Union-level targets.",
      "Parallel to this Regulation, the Commission has developed and adopted a series of initiatives in sectoral energy policy, in particular with regard torenewable energy,energy efficiency, including on the energy performance ofbuildings, and market design. Those initiatives form a package under the overarching theme ofenergy efficiency first, the Union's global leadership in renewables, and a fair deal for energy consumers, including by addressing energy poverty and promoting fair competition in the internal market.",
      "The Energy Union should cover five dimensions: energy security; the internal energy market; energy efficiency; decarbonisation; and research, innovation and competitiveness.",
      "The goal of a resilient Energy Union with an ambitious climate policy at its core is to give Union consumers, including households and businesses, secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy, and to foster research and innovation by means of attracting investment, which requires a fundamental transformation of Europe's energy system. Such a transformation is also closely linked to the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to promote the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, in particular through the promotion ofenergy efficiencyandenergy savings and the development of new and renewable forms of energy. That goal can be achieved only through coordinated action, combining both legislative and non-legislative acts at Union, regional, national and local level.",
      "The main objective of the governance mechanism should therefore be to enable the achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union and in particular the targets of the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy, in the field of GHG emission reduction, energy from renewable sources and energy efficiency. Those objectives and targets stem from the Union policy on energy and from the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to promote the prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, as provided for in the EU Treaties. None of those objectives, which are indissociably linked, can be regarded as secondary to the other. This Regulation is therefore linked to sectoral law implementing the 2030 targets for energy and climate. While Member States need flexibility to choose policies that are best-matched to their national energy mix and preferences, that flexibility should be compatible with further market integration, increased competition, the attainment of climate and energy objectives and the gradual shift towards a sustainable low-carbon economy.",
      "As is the case for planning, sectoral Union law in the energy and climate fields sets out reporting requirements, many of which have been useful tools to drive change at the national level, complementary to market reforms, but those requirements have been introduced at different times, leading to overlaps and cost-inefficiency, as well as insufficient consideration of synergies and interactions between policy areas such as GHG mitigation, renewable energy, energy efficiency and market integration. To strike the right balance between the need to ensure a proper follow-up of the implementation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and the need to reduce administrative complexity, Member States should establish biennial progress reports on the implementation of the plans and other developments in the energy system. Some reporting however, particularly with regard to reporting requirements in the climate field stemming from the UNFCCC and Union law, would still be necessary on an annual basis.",

      "The integrated national energy and climate plans should cover ten-year periods and should provide an overview of the current energy system and policy situation. They should set out national objectives for each of the five dimensions of the Energy Union and corresponding policies and measures to meet those objectives and have an analytical basis. The integrated national energy and climate plans covering the first period from 2021 to 2030 should pay particular attention to the 2030 targets for GHG emission reductions, renewable energy, energy efficiency and electricity interconnection. Member States should aim to ensure that the integrated national energy and climate plans are consistent with, and contribute to, achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In their integrated national energy and climate plans, Member States may build upon existing national strategies or plans. For the first draft and final integrated national energy and climate plan, a different deadline is provided as compared to subsequent plans, in order to provide Member States with adequate preparation time for their first plans after the adoption of this Regulation. Nevertheless, Member States are encouraged to provide their first draft integrated national energy and climate plans as early as possible in 2018, in order to allow proper preparation, in particular for the facilitative dialogue to be convened in 2018 in accordance with Decision 1/CP.21 of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",
      "As is the case for planning, sectoral Union law in the energy and climate fields sets out reporting requirements, many of which have been useful tools to drive change at the national level, complementary to market reforms, but those requirements have been introduced at different times, leading to overlaps and cost-inefficiency, as well as insufficient consideration of synergies and interactions between policy areas such as GHG mitigation,renewable energy,energy efficiency and market integration. To strike the right balance between the need to ensure a proper follow-up of the implementation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and the need to reduce administrative complexity, Member States should establish biennial progress reports on the implementation of the plans and other developments in the energy system. Some reporting however, particularly with regard to reporting requirements in the climate field stemming from the UNFCCC and Union law, would still be necessary on an annual basis.",
      "Should the ambition of integrated national energy and climate plans or their updates be insufficient for the collective achievement of the Energy Union objectives and, for the first period, in particular the 2030 targets forrenewable energyandenergy efficiency, the Commission should take measures at Union level in order to ensure the collective achievement of those objectives and targets (thereby closing any \u2018ambition gap\u2019). Should progress made by the Union towards those objectives and targets be insufficient for their delivery, the Commission should, in addition to issuing recommendations, propose measures and exercise its powers at Union level or Member States should take additional measures in order to ensure achievement of these objectives and targets (thereby closing any \u2018delivery gap\u2019). Such measures should also take into accountearly effortsmade by Member States towards the 2030 target for renewable energy by reaching in or before 2020 a share ofenergy from renewable sourcesabove its national binding target, or by making early progress towards its national binding 2020 target or in the implementation of its contribution to the Union's binding target of at least 32 % of renewable energy in 2030. In the area of renewable energy, such measures can also include voluntary financial contributions by Member States to a Union renewable energy financing mechanism managed by the Commission, which would be used to contribute to the most cost-efficient renewable energy projects across the Union, thus providing the Member States with the option to contribute to the Union target achievement at the lowest possible cost. Member States' national renewable energy targets for 2020 should serve as baseline shares of renewable energy from 2021 onwards and should be maintained throughout the period. In the area of energy efficiency, additional measures can, in particular, aim to improve the energy efficiency of products,buildings and transport.",
      "Parallel to this Regulation, the Commission has developed and adopted a series of initiatives in sectoral energy policy, in particular with regard to renewable energy, energy efficiency, including on the energy performance of buildings, and market design. Those initiatives form a package under the overarching theme of energy efficiency first, the Union's global leadership in renewables, and a fair deal for energy consumers, including by addressing energy poverty and promoting fair competition in the internal market.",

      "In its conclusions of 23 and 24 October 2014, the European Council endorsed a 2030 Framework for Energy and Climate for the Union based on four key Union-level targets: a reduction of at least 40 % in economy-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, an indicative target of improvement inenergy efficiencyof at least 27 %, to be reviewed by 2020 with a view to increasing the level to 30 %, a share ofrenewable energy consumed in the Union of at least 27 %, and electricity interconnection of at least 15 %. It specified that the target for renewable energy is binding at Union level and that it will be fulfilled through Member States' contributions guided by the need to deliver collectively the Union target. A recast of Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) has introduced a new, binding, renewable energy target for the Union for 2030 of at least 32 %, including a provision for a review with a view to increasing the Union-level target by 2023. Amendments to Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) have set the Union-level target for improvements in energy efficiency in 2030 to at least 32,5 %, including a provision for a review with a view to increasing the Union-level targets.",
      "The integrated national energy and climate plans should cover ten-year periods and should provide an overview of the current energy system and policy situation. They should set out national objectives for each of the five dimensions of the Energy Union and correspondingpolicies and measuresto meet those objectives and have an analytical basis. The integrated national energy and climate plans covering the first period from 2021 to 2030 should pay particular attention to the 2030 targets for GHG emission reductions,renewable energy,energy efficiency and electricity interconnection. Member States should aim to ensure that the integrated national energy and climate plans are consistent with, and contribute to, achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In their integrated national energy and climate plans, Member States may build upon existing national strategies or plans.
