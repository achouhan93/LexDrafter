If required, it de-crypts the data using the cipher provided by the meter operator in step 5.3. It is recommended that at the end of step 6.3, attributes of information object P must be available in a form that can easily be used in the follow-up processes. When mapping this step, it is not enough to refer to a standard - descriptions of all necessary steps must be provided exhaustively.",
