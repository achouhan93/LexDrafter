  "original_definition": "'fluorescence' means the phenomenon or a light source using an electric gas discharge of the low-pressure mercury type in which most of the light is emitted by one or more layers of phosphors excited by the ultraviolet radiation from the discharge. Fluorescent light sources may have one (\u2018single-capped\u2019) or two (\u2018double-capped\u2019) connections (\u2018caps\u2019) to their electricity supply. For the purposes of this Regulation, magnetic induction light sources are also considered as fluorescent light sources;",
  "generated_definition": "'fluorescence' means the phenomenon of emitting light by a substance that has absorbed energy from an external source, resulting in the re-emission of light with a different wavelength, typically at a lower intensity than the absorbed energy.",
