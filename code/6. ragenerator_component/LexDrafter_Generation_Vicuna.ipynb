      ". ---Voluntary schemes shall establish detailed procedures setting out how audits are planned and conducted and how audit reports are drawn up. Voluntary schemes shall ensure that certification bodies conduct audits in accordance with ISO 19011 or the equivalent. Voluntary schemes shall also ensure an efficient and timely exchange of audit information between them to support the effective preparation and conduct of the audit. The audit shall include at least the following elements:\n",
      "in the case of critical non-conformities, economic operators applying for certification shall not be issued acertificate.Economic operators may re-apply for certification after the lapse of a fixed period of time, determined by thevoluntary scheme. Critical non-conformities identified during surveillance orre-certification audits, or through a voluntary scheme’s internal monitoring or complaints process, shall lead to the immediate withdrawal of the economic operator’s certificate;\n",
      "2. Voluntary schemes may authorise a certification body to perform the verification of compliance with different certification frameworks during the same auditing process, as long as the certification body certifies that economic operators satisfy the requirements in line with Article 1. Voluntary schemes that allow a certificate duration longer than one year shall ensure the carrying out of an annual surveillance audit of all economic operators participating in the scheme. However, in the case of group audits, the annual audit may cover a sample of the group members in accordance with Article 12. The frequency of surveillance audits shall be increased on the basis of the level of overall risk related to the profile of the economic operator, the supply chain and the results of previous audits. The technical reviewer shall be responsible for validating the results of surveillance audits.\n",
      "The intentional violation of a voluntary scheme’s standards such as fraud, irreversible non-conformity, or a violation that jeopardies the integrity of the voluntary scheme shall be considered to be a critical non-conformity. Critical non-conformities shall include, but are not limited to, the following:\n",
      "in the case of major non-conformities, economic operators applying for certification shall not be issued a certificate. Major non-conformities identified during surveillance or re-certification audits, or through a voluntary scheme’s internal monitoring or complaints process, shall lead to the immediate suspension of the economic operator’s certificate. Where economic operators do not provide a remedy for any major non-conformities within 90 days from notification, the certificate shall be withdrawn;\n",
      "the omission of aneconomic operatorto declare its participation in othervoluntary schemes during the certification process;\n",
      "6. The audit reports and summary audit reports orcertificates drawn up or issued by acertification bodywithin the framework of avoluntary scheme shall at least include the elements set out in Annex II.\n",
      "1. Voluntary schemes shall require that economic operators successfully pass an initial audit before allowing them to participate in the scheme. The initial audit of a new scheme participant or a re-certification of existing scheme participant under a revised regulatory framework shall always be on-site and shall as a minimum provide reasonable assurance on the effectiveness of its internal processes. Depending on the risk profile of the economic operator, a limited assurance level can be applied on the veracity of its statements. On the basis of the results of the initial audit, those economic operators who are considered low risk may be subject to subsequent limited assurance audits.\n",
      "in the case of minor non-conformities, voluntary schemes may define the time period for their resolution, not exceeding 12 months from their notification and the date of next surveillance or re-certification audit.\n",

      "The term \"partial load\" refers to a situation where the load being dried is not fully loaded, but only partially loaded. The weighted programme time (Tt) of the standard cotton programme at full and partial load is the time it takes to dry a standard wet cotton load, taking into account the load size and the type of dryer. The programme time of the standard cotton programme at full load (Tdry) is the time it takes to dry a fully loaded standard wet cotton load, while the programme time of the standard cotton programme at partial load (Tdry1/2) is half the time it takes to dry a fully loaded standard wet cotton load. The condensation efficiency of a programme is a measure of how well the programme removes moisture from the load being dried. The average condensation efficiency of the standard cotton programme at full and partial load is used to calculate the weighted condensation efficiency. The energy consumption of a household tumble drier for the standard cotton programme at full and partial load is calculated in kWh and rounded to two decimal places. The energy efficiency index (EEI) of a household tumble drier model is calculated by comparing the weighted annual energy consumption of the model for the standard cotton programme at full and partial load to its standard annual energy consumption. The term \"partial load\" is used in the context of household tumble driers to describe a situation where the load being dried is not fully loaded, but only partially loaded.\n",

      ". ---Australia further notes that it would not be appropriate for dispute settlement bodies established under the Treaty to give interpretations of GATT Articles III and XI in the context of disputes between parties to the GATT or between an investor of a party to the GATT and another party to the GATT. It considers that with respect to the application of Article 10 (11) between an investor and a party to the GATT, the only issue that can be considered under Article 26 is the issue of the awards of arbitration in the event that a GATT panel or the WTO dispute settlement body first establishes that a trade-related investment measure maintained by the Contracting Party is inconsistent with its obligations under the GATT or the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures.\n",
      "The notion ‘applied on 1 March 1994 and practised with regard to energy materials and products by parties to GATT 1947 among themselves’ is not intended to refer to cases where a party to the GATT has invoked Article XXXV of the GATT, thereby disapplying the GATT vis-à-vis another party to the GATT, but nevertheless applies unilaterally on a de facto basis some provisions of the GATT vis-à-vis that other party to the GATT.\n",
      "Nothing in this Treaty shall derogate, as between particular Contracting Parties which are parties to the GATT, from the provisions of the GATT and Related Instruments as they are applied between those Contracting Parties.\n",
      "Where a provision of GATT 1947 or a Related Instrument referred to in this paragraph provides for joint action by parties to the GATT, it is intended that the Charter Conference take such action.\n",
      "Exceptions contained in the GATT and Related Instruments apply between particular Contracting Parties which are parties to the GATT, as recognized by Article 4. With respect to trade in energy materials and products governed by Article 29, that Article specifies the provisions relevant to the subjects covered by Article 24.\n",
      "The representatives' agreement to Article 5 is not meant to imply any position on whether or to what extent the provisions of the ‘Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures’ annexed to the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations are implicit in Articles III and XI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\n",
      "Australia notes that the provisions of Articles 5 and 10 (11) do not diminish its rights and obligations under the GATT, including as elaborated in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures, particularly with respect to the list of exceptions in Article 5 (3), which it considers incomplete.\n",
