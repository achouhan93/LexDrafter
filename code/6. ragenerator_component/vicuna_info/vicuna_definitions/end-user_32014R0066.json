      "The ecodesign requirements should be introduced gradually in three tiers in order to provide a sufficient timeframe for manufacturers to redesign products subject to this Regulation. Such timeframe should avoid any negative impact on the functionality of equipment already on the market and should take into account costs incurred by end-users and manufacturers, in particular small- and medium-sized enterprises, while ensuring timely achievement of the objectives of this Regulation.",
      "The ecodesign requirements should not affect functionality from the end-user\u2019s perspective and should not negatively affect health, safety or the environment. In particular, the benefits of reducing energy consumption during the use phase should more than offset any possible additional environmental impact during the production phase and at the time of disposal."
