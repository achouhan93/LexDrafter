      "In view of the collective achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union Strategy, in particular the creation of a fully functional and resilient Energy Union, it will be essential for the Commission to assess the draft integrated national energy and climate plans, the integrated national energy and climate plans and, based on progress reports, their implementation. For the first ten-year period, this concerns in particular the achievement of the Union's 2030 targets for energy and climate and national contributions to those targets. Such assessment should be undertaken on a biennial basis, and on an annual basis only where necessary, and should be consolidated in the Commission's State of the Energy Union reports."
