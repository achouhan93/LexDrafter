      "3.   For the purpose of tracing consignments of liquid or gaseous fuels in an interconnected infrastructure and subject to the same mass balancing system, the sustainability and GHG emissions saving characteristics and the other information as described in paragraph 1 shall be registered in the Union database at the first entry point and registered out as consumed at the point of final consumption. If gaseous fuels are withdrawn from an interconnected infrastructure and further transformed into gaseous or liquid fuels, the point of final consumption is considered to be the point of final consumption of the final gaseous or liquid fuels. In such a case, all intermediary stages from the withdrawal of the gaseous fuels from the interconnected infrastructure until the point of final consumption of the final gaseous or liquid fuels have to be registered in the Union Database.",
