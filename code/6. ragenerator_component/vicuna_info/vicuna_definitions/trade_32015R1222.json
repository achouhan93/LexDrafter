      "3.   Two years after the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission shall forward a report to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 on the development of single day-ahead and intraday coupling in the Member States, with particular emphasis on the development of competition between NEMOs. On the basis of that report, and if the Commission deems that there is no justification for the continuation of national legal monopolies or for the continued refusal of a Member State to allow cross-border trading by a NEMO designated in another Member State, the Commission may consider appropriate legislative or other appropriate measures to further increase competition and trade between and within Member States. The Commission shall also include an assessment in the report evaluating the governance of single day-ahead and intraday coupling established by this Regulation, with particular emphasis on the transparency of MCO functions carried jointly by the NEMOs. On the basis of that report, and if the Commission deems that there is ambiguity in carrying out the monopolistic MCO functions and other NEMO tasks, the Commission may consider appropriate legislative or other appropriate measures to further increase transparency and efficient functioning of single day-ahead and intraday coupling.",

      "Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 sets out non-discriminatory rules for access conditions to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity and, in particular, rules on capacity allocation and congestion management for interconnections and transmission systems affecting cross-border electricity flows. In order to move towards a genuinely integrated electricity market, the current rules on capacity allocation, congestion management and trade in electricity should be further harmonised. This Regulation therefore sets out minimum harmonised rules for the ultimately single day-ahead and intraday coupling, in order to provide a clear legal framework for an efficient and modern capacity allocation and congestion management system, facilitating Union-wide trade in electricity, allowing more efficient use of the network and increasing competition, for the benefit of consumers.",
      "However, single day-ahead and intraday coupling should only be implemented stepwise, as the regulatory framework for electricity trade and the physical structure of the transmission grid are characterised by significant differences between Member States and regions. The introduction of single day-ahead and intraday coupling therefore requires a successive alignment of the existing methodologies on capacity calculation, allocation and congestion management. Single intraday and day-ahead coupling may therefore be introduced at a regional level as an intermediate step where necessary.",
