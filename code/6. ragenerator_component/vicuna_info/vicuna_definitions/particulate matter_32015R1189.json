      "The combined effect of the ecodesign requirements set out in this Regulation and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/1187 (2) is estimated to result by 2030 in annual energy savings of approximately 18 PJ (approximately 0,4 Mtoe), together with related carbon dioxide (\u2018CO2\u2019) emission reductions of approximately 0,2 Mt, and a reduction of 10 kt in particulate matter, 14 kt in organic gaseous compounds, and 130 kt in carbon monoxide.",
      "The environmental aspects of solid fuel boilers that have been identified as significant for the purposes of this Regulation are energy consumption in the use phase and emissions of particulate matter (dust), organic gaseous compounds, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides in the use phase. The annual energy consumption related to solid fuel boilers is expected to be 530 petajoules (\u2018PJ\u2019) (approximately 12,7 million tonnes of oil equivalent \u2018Mtoe\u2019) in 2030 and annual emissions are expected to be 25 kilotonnes (\u2018kt\u2019) of particulate matter, 25 kt of organic gaseous compounds and 292 kt of carbon monoxide in 2030. Emissions of nitrogen oxides are expected to increase because of potential new solid fuel boiler designs aiming at higher energy efficiency and lower organic emissions. The preparatory study shows that use-phase energy consumption and emissions by solid fuel boilers can be significantly reduced."
