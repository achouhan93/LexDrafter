      "For double duct and single duct air conditioners, steady-state energy efficiency performance indicators should continue to be applied, as there are currently no inverter units on the market. As no reclassification of these appliances is appropriate, single and double duct air conditioners should have an A+++-D scale. While these, inherently less efficient than split appliances, can go only up to an A+ energy efficiency class in a scale of A+++-D, the more efficient split appliances can reach up to the A+++ energy efficiency class.",
