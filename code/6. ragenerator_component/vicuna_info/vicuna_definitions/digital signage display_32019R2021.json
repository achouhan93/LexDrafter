      "The annual energy consumption in 2016 of televisions in the Union constituted more than 3 % of the European Union\u2019s electricity consumption. The projected energy consumption of televisions, monitors and digital signage displays would be expected be close to 100 TWh/yr in 2030. This Regulation, together with the accompanying energy labelling regulation, is estimated to reduce the overall consumption by 39 TWh/yr by 2030.",

Therefore they should all be subject to the same requirements for proper end of life treatment and they should also facilitate circular economy objectives. Howeverelectronic displays integrated into computers, such as tablets, laptops or all-in-one desktops, although hardly distinguishable from other electronic displays, should be covered in a review of Commission Regulation (EU) No 617/2013 (11) on computers.",
      "Digital signage displays are used in public spaces such as airports, metro and train stations, retail stores, shop windows, restaurants, museums, hotels, conference centres or in prominent positions outside buildings and represent a relevant emerging market. Their energy needs are different and generally higher than those of other electronic displays because they are often used in luminous places and continuously on. Minimum requirements for digital signage displays in on-mode should be evaluated once additional data will be available, however they should at least have minimum requirements on off, standby and networked standby modes and on material efficiency.",
