      "Ecodesign requirements should harmonise energy consumption, particulate matter, organic gaseous compounds, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides emission requirements for solid fuel local space heaters throughout the Union, for the internal market to operate better and in order to improve the environmental performance of those products.",
      "Annual emissions of particulate matter (PM), organic gaseous compounds (OGCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been estimated at 142 kton/year, 119 kton/year and 1 658 kton/year respectively in 2010. As a result of specific measures adopted by Member States and technological development, these emissions are expected to be 94 kton/year, 49 kton/year and 1 433 kton/year respectively in 2030. Annual emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are expected to increase in the absence of specific measures because new local space heaters designs will rely on higher combustion temperatures.",
