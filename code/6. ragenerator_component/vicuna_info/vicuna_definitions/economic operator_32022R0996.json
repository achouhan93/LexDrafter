This should also apply to situations where the economic operator has a new legal personality but remains the same in substance, so that minor or purely formal changes, for instance, in the governance structure or the scope of activities, do not exempt the new economic operator from such a rule.",
      "Economic operators may decide at any time to participate in a differentvoluntary scheme. However, in order to prevent an economic operator that has failed an audit under one scheme from immediately applying for certification under another scheme, all schemes receiving an application from an economic operator should require that operator to supply information about whether it failed an audit in the previous 5 years. This should also apply to situations where the economic operator has a new legal personality but remains the same in substance, so that minor or purely formal changes, for instance, in the governance structure or the scope of activities, do not exempt the new economic operator from such a rule.",
      "Economic operators applying for low ILUC-risk certification can already have obtained a certification for other aspects by avoluntary scheme, or can apply for low ILUC-risk certification at the same time as applying for a certification for other aspects that can be covered by a voluntary scheme. Applicants can be a farm, a group of farmers or afirst gathering point or a group manager acting on behalf of a group of farmers. In case of measures being applied to perennial crops, the start of the 10-year validity period of low ILUC certification can be postponed due to the delay between the measure being implemented and the yield increase being observed.",

      "In the preparation of the initial on-site audit as well as during subsequent surveillance or re-certification audits, the auditor should make an appropriate analysis of the overall risk profile of economic operators. Based on the auditor\u2019s professional knowledge and the information submitted by the economic operator, this analysis should take into consideration not only the level of risk of the specific economic operator but also of the supply chain (e.g. for economic operators that handle materials listed in Annex IX to Directive (EU) 2018/2001). The audit intensity, its scope, or both, should be adapted to the level of identified overall risk in order to ensure an adequate level of trust in the veracity of the information provided by the economic operators, mitigating the risks for material misstatements.",
      "In order to establish whether biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels, renewable gaseous and liquid transport fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels comply with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, the correct and harmonised functioning ofvoluntary schemes is essential. Harmonised rules should therefore be established, to apply across the certification system, bringing about the necessary legal certainty on the rules applicable toeconomic operators and voluntary schemes.",
