    "Not Article": [
      "The availability of oil stocks and the safeguarding of energy supply are essential elements of public security for Member States and for the Community. The existence of central stockholding entities (CSEs) in the Community brings those goals closer. In order to allow the Member States concerned to make optimal use of national law to define the terms of reference for their CSEs while easing the financial burden placed on final consumers as a result of such stockholding activities, it is sufficient to prohibit the use of stocks for commercial purposes, while allowing stocks to be held in any location across the Community and by any CSE set up for that purpose.",
      "In order to enhance security of supply, provide the markets with fuller information, reassure consumers about the state of oil stocks and optimise the way in which information is transmitted, provision should be made for possible subsequent amendment or clarification of the rules for the preparation and submission of statistical summaries.",
      "Given the objectives of the Community legislation on oil stocks, possible security concerns which may be expressed by some Member States and the desire to make mechanisms for solidarity amongst Member States more rigorous and more transparent, it is necessary to focus as much as possible the operation of CSEs to their national territories.",
      "The European Council, in its Action Plan (2007 to 2009), entitled \u2018Energy Policy for Europe\u2019, underlined the need to enhance security of supply for the European Union (EU) as a whole and for each Member State, inter alia, by reviewing the Union\u2019s oil stocks mechanisms, with special reference to the availability of oil in the event of a crisis.",
      "It should be possible for oil stocks to be held at any location across the Community, provided that due account is taken of their physical accessibility. Consequently, economic operators on which such stockholding obligations fall should be able to discharge their obligations by delegation to other economic operators or any one of the CSEs. Furthermore, provided those obligations can be delegated to a freely chosen CSE located within the Community on payment of an amount limited to the cost of the services provided, the risk of discriminatory practices at national level will be reduced. The right of an economic operator to delegate should not imply an obligation on the part of any actor to accept the delegation, unless this Directive requires otherwise. When Member States decide to limit operators' delegation rights, they should ensure that operators are guaranteed the right to delegate a certain minimum percentage of their obligation; those Member States should therefore ensure that their CSE will accept the delegation of the stockholding obligation in respect of the amount needed to guarantee that minimum percentage.",
