They should set out national objectives for each of the five dimensions of the Energy Union and correspondingpolicies and measuresto meet those objectives and have an analytical basis. The integrated national energy and climate plans covering the first period from 2021 to 2030 should pay particular attention to the 2030 targets for GHG emission reductions,renewable energy,energy efficiency and electricity interconnection. Member States should aim to ensure that the integrated national energy and climate plans are consistent with, and contribute to, achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In their integrated national energy and climate plans, Member States may build upon existing national strategies or plans. For the first draft and final integrated national energy and climate plan, a different deadline is provided as compared to subsequent plans, in order to provide Member States with adequate preparation time for their first plans after the adoption of this Regulation. Nevertheless, Member States are encouraged to provide their first draft integrated national energy and climate plans as early as possible in 2018, in order to allow proper preparation, in particular for the facilitative dialogue to be convened in 2018 in accordance with Decision 1/CP.21 of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)."
