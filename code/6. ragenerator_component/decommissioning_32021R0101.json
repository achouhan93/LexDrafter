Knowledge and experience gained and lessons learnt under the Programme with regard to the nuclear decommissioning process should be disseminated in the Union, in coordination and synergy with the other relevant Union programmes for decommissioning activities in Bulgaria, Slovakia and the Commission\u2019s nuclear installations at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) sites, as such measures bring the greatest EU added value and contribute to the safety of the workers and the general public as well as protection of the environment. The scope, procedure and economic aspects of cooperation should be detailed in the multiannual work programme and could also be subject to agreements between the Member States and/or with the Commission.",
      "In line with its obligations under the Act of Accession and with Union assistance, Lithuania shut down the two units within the respective deadlines and made significant progress towards their decommissioning. Further work is necessary in order to continue the decrease in the level of radiological hazard. Based on the available estimates, additional financial resources are required for that purpose after 2020.",
      "Effective monitoring and control of the evolution of the decommissioning process should be ensured by Lithuania and the Commission in order to assure the highest EU added value of the funding allocated under this Regulation, although the ultimate responsibility for the decommissioning rests with Lithuania. This includes effective measurement of progress and performance, and the enacting of corrective measures where necessary. To that end, a committee with monitoring and information functions should be established and co-chaired by a representative of the Commission and of Lithuania.",
      "The premature shutdown and subsequent decommissioning of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, with two 1 500 MW RBMK-type reactor units inherited from the Soviet Union, was of an unprecedented nature and represented for Lithuania an exceptional financial burden not commensurate with the size and economic strength of the country. Protocol No 4 states that the Union financial assistance in support of Lithuania\u2019s efforts to decommission and to address the consequences of the closure and decommissioning of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant is to be seamlessly continued and extended beyond 2006 for the period of the next Financial Perspectives.",

      "The decommissioning of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant should be carried out with recourse to the best available technical expertise, and with due regard to the nature and technological specifications of the installations to be decommissioned, in order to ensure safety and the highest possible efficiency, thus taking into account international best practices.",
      "Due account has been taken of the Special Report No 22/2016 of the Court of Auditors entitled \u2018EU nuclear decommissioning assistance programmes in Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia: some progress made since 2011, but critical challenges ahead\u2019, its recommendations and the reply from the Commission.",
      "The financing pursuant to this Regulation should concentrate on activities implementing the safety objectives of the decommissioning.",
      "Note has been taken of the European Parliament legislative resolution of 17 January 2019 on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing the nuclear decommissioning assistance programme of the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania (Ignalina programme); and repealing Council Regulation (EU) No 1369/2013.",
