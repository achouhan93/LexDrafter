      "The preparatory study shows that requirements regarding the other ecodesign parameters referred to in Annex I, Part 1 to Directive 2009/125/EC are not necessary in the case ofwater heaters andhot water storage tanks. In particular, greenhouse gas emissions related to refrigerants used inheat pump water heaters for heating today\u2019s European building stock are not identified as significant. The appropriateness of setting ecodesign requirements for these greenhouse gas emissions will be reassessed when reviewing this Regulation.",
      "The environmental aspects of water heaters that have been identified as significant for the purposes of this Regulation are energy consumption in the use phase and (for heat pump water heaters) sound power levels. In addition, for water heaters using fossil fuels, emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are also identified as significant environmental aspects. The significant environmental aspect of hot water storage tanks is energy consumption due to their standing losses.",
