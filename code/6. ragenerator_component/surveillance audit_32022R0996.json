Voluntary schemes may authorise a certification body to perform the verification of compliance with different certification frameworks during the same auditing process, as long as the certification body certifies that economic operators satisfy the requirements in line with Article 1. Voluntary schemes that allow a certificate duration longer than one year shall ensure the carrying out of an annual surveillance audit of all economic operators participating in the scheme.

The frequency of surveillance audits shall be increased on the basis of the level of overall risk related to the profile of the economic operator, the supply chain and the results of previous audits. The technical reviewer shall be responsible for validating the results of surveillance audits.",
