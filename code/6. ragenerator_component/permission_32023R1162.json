Moreover, it ensures that suppliers and service providers have transparent and seamless access to final customers\u2019 data, in a manner that the data is easy for them to understand and use, provided that customers have given the requiredpermission. Upon receiving this permission, themetered data administratorprovides the relevant data covered by this authorisation to theeligible party chosen by the final customer. Moreover, this specific authorisation procedure could be linked to a contractual agreement, or to an explicit clause within the contractual agreement with the eligible party. This way, interoperability is ensured in a manner that respects consumer rights over their data, and market participants have a shared understanding of the type of data and workflows that are required for specific services and processes. Customers can be required to give permission to suppliers or other market participants such as aggregators as part of their contractual agreements.

      "Industry practice is to separate interoperability into five layers. The business layer relates to the business objectives and roles for certain services or processes. The function layer relates to the use cases, data sharing and permission management. The information layer relates to data models and information models, such as CIM (2). The communication layer relates to the communication protocols and data formats such as CSV (3) or XML (4). The component layer relates to data exchange platforms, applications and hardware such as meters and sensors."
