  "generated_definition": "'energy performance of a building' means the energy performance of a building refers to the measure of the energy efficiency of a building in terms of its ability to maintain a comfortable internal environment while using minimal energy. it includes the energy consumption of the building for heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water production, as well as the energy losses due to inefficiencies in the building's envelope, such as air leaks and thermal bridging.",

      "The energy performance of a building shall be determined on the basis of the calculated or actual annual energy that is consumed in order to meet the different needs associated with its typical use and shall reflect the heating energy needs and cooling energy needs (energy needed to avoid overheating) to maintain the envisaged temperature conditions of the building, and domestic hot water needs.",

      "The energy performance of buildings should be calculated on the basis of a methodology, which may be differentiated at national and regional level. That includes, in addition to thermal characteristics, other factors that play an increasingly important role such as heating and air-conditioning installations, application of energy from renewable sources, passive heating and cooling elements, shading, indoor air-quality, adequate natural light and design of the building. The methodology for calculating energy performance should be based not only on the season in which heating is required, but should cover the annual energy performance of a building. That methodology should take into account existing European standards.",
