      "To implement single day-ahead and intraday coupling, the available cross-bordercapacity needs to be calculated in a coordinated manner by the Transmission System Operators (hereinafter \u2018TSOs\u2019). For this purpose, they should establish acommon grid model including estimates on generation, load and network status for each hour. The available capacity should normally be calculated according to the so-called flow-based calculation method, a method that takes into account that electricity can flow via different paths and optimises the available capacity in highly interdependent grids. The available cross-border capacity should be one of the key inputs into the further calculation process, in which all Union bids and offers, collected by power exchanges, are matched, taking into account available cross-border capacity in an economically optimal manner. Single day-ahead and intraday coupling ensures that power usually flows from low- price to high- price areas.",
      "Establishing single day-ahead and intraday coupling process requires cooperation between potentially competing power exchanges in order to establish common market coupling functions. That is why oversight and compliance with competition rules is of utmost importance regarding these common functions.",

Bidding zones therefore should be defined in a manner to ensure efficient congestion management and overall market efficiency. Bidding zones can be subsequently modified by splitting, merging or adjusting the zone borders. The bidding zones should be identical for allmarket time-frames. The review process of bidding zone configurations provided for in this Regulation will play an important role in the identification of structural bottlenecks and will allow for more efficient bidding zone delineation.",
