      "\u2018lighting control parts\u2019 means parts that are integrated in alight source, or physically separated but marketed together with a light source as a single product, that are not strictly necessary for the light source to emit light at full-load, but that enable manual \u2014 or automatic-, direct- or remote-, control of luminous intensity,chromaticity, correlated colour temperature, light spectrum and/or beam angle. Dimmers shall also be considered as lighting control parts.",
