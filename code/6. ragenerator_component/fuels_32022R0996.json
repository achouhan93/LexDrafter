The amount of fuel use in farm machinery shall be duly documented. Appropriate emission factors of the fuels must be used in accordance with Annex IX. Where biofuels are used, the default GHG emissions set out in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 must be used.",

The emissions are calculated using appropriate emission factors for the type of fuel used (diesel oil, gasoline, heavy fuel oil, biofuels or other fuels).",
      "The emissions from the extraction or cultivation process itself shall include all emissions from (i) the provision of the fuels for farm machinery used; (ii) the production of seeding material for crop cultivation; (iii) the production of fertilisers and pesticides; (iv) fertiliser acidification and liming application; and (v) soil emissions from crop cultivation.",
      "The cultivation emissions shall include emissions from drying before storage as well as from storage and handling of biomass feedstock. Data on energy use for drying before storage shall include actual data on the drying process used to comply with the requirements of storage, depending on the biomass type, particle size, moisture content, weather conditions, etc. Appropriate emission factors, including upstream emissions, shall be used to account for the emissions from the use offuelsto produce heat or electricity used for drying. Emissions for drying include only emissions for the drying process needed to ensure adequate storage ofraw materials and does not include drying of materials during processing.",

      "In order to establish whether biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels, renewable gaseous and liquid transport fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels comply with the requirements of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, the correct and harmonised functioning of voluntary schemes is essential. Harmonised rules should therefore be established, to apply across the certification system, bringing about the necessary legal certainty on the rules applicable to economic operators and voluntary schemes.",
      "Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/807 (2), acknowledges that under certain circumstances, the indirect land-use change (ILUC) impacts of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels that are considered as high ILUC-risk can be avoided. In order to ensure a level playing field in the implementation of the low ILUC-risk certification process across voluntary schemes, it is necessary to lay down specific requirements to allow for certification of low ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. Certified low ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels should be exempted from the limit and gradual reduction set for high ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels produced from food and feed crops, provided that they meet the relevant sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria laid down in Article 29 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.",

Furthermore, the voluntary schemes can be used to certify biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels with low indirect land-use change-risk.",

      "The mass balance system aims to reduce the administrative burden for demonstrating compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas saving criteria by allowing mixing of raw material and fuels with differing sustainability characteristics and by allowing reassignment of the sustainability characteristics in a flexible manner to consignments withdrawn from such a mixture. In order to ensure transparency, mixing under the mass balance system is possible if e.g. raw material belong to the same product group. A product group can comprise for instance different types of non-food cellulosic material with similar physical and chemical characteristics, heating values and/or conversion factors or the types of ligno-cellulosic material covered under point q of Annex IX Part A to Directive (EU) 2018/2001. Virgin vegetable oils, used for the production of biofuels and bioliquids, may belong to the same product group. Raw materials, however, that can be used to produce biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels which are subject to different rules concerning their contribution towards the targets for renewable energy should generally not be considered to be part of the same product group as this would risk to undermine the objectives of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, which applies differentiated treatment of biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels on the basis of the feedstock they are produced from. In case of gaseous fuels, the EU interconnected grid is considered as one single mass balancing system. Gaseous fuels produced and consumed off the grid or through isolated local distribution networks are to be considered as separate mass balancing systems. Further, precautionary measures are required to ensure the consistency of sustainability claims when fuels are exported to third countries which do not apply the mass balance system. To this end, the mass balance system should also include information on quantities of fuels for which no sustainability characteristics have been determined and deliveries of fuels to uncertified operators shall be taken into account in the mass balance system, based on the physical nature of delivered fuels.",
