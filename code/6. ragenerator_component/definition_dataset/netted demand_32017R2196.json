      "5.   Each TSO shall design the scheme for the automatic low frequency demand disconnection in accordance with the parameters for shedding load in real-time laid down in the Annex. The scheme shall include the disconnection of demand at different frequencies, from a \u2018starting mandatory level\u2019 to a \u2018final mandatory level\u2019, within an implementation range whilst respecting a minimum number and maximum size of steps. The implementation range shall define the maximum admissible deviation of netted demand to be disconnected from the target netted demand to be disconnected at a given frequency, calculated through a linear interpolation between starting and final mandatory levels. The implementation range shall not allow the disconnection of less netted demand than the amount of netted demand to be disconnected at the starting mandatory level. A step cannot be considered as such if no netted demand is disconnected when this step is reached.",
      "10.   A TSO may include in the scheme for automatic low frequency demand disconnection of its system defence plan additional steps for netted demand disconnection below the final mandatory level of demand disconnection set out in the Annex.",
      "9.   In case the scheme for the automatic low frequency demand disconnection of the system defence plan includes netted demand disconnection based on frequency gradient, as described in paragraph 8, the TSO shall submit, within 30 days of the implementation, a report containing a detailed explanation of the rationale, implementation and impact of this measure to the national regulatory authority."

      "1.   In addition to the measures set out in Articles 18 to 21, each TSO may establish an amount of netted demand to be manually disconnected, directly by the TSO or indirectly through DSOs, when necessary to prevent the propagation or worsening of an emergency state. Where demand is to be directly disconnected, the TSO shall inform the relevant DSOs without delay."

Each DSO concerned by the implementation of the low frequency demand disconnection on its installations shall update once a year the communication to the notifying system operator provided for in point (b) of Article 12(6). This communication shall include the frequency settings at which netted demand disconnection is initiated and the percentage of netted demand disconnected at every such setting."
