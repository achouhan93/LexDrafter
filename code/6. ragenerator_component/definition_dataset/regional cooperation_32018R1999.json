      "The governance mechanism is based on long-term strategies, integrated national energy and climate plans covering ten-year periods starting from 2021 to 2030, corresponding integrated national energy and climate progress reports by the Member States and integrated monitoring arrangements by the Commission. The governance mechanism ensures effective opportunities for the public to participate in the preparation of those national plans and those long-term strategies. It comprises a structured, transparent, iterative process between the Commission and Member States for the purpose of the finalisation of the integrated national energy and climate plans and their subsequent implementation, including with regard to regional cooperation, and corresponding Commission action."

      "Where they cooperate in the framework of this Regulation, Member States should take into consideration existing regional cooperation fora, such as the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP), Central and South-Eastern Europe Connectivity (CESEC), Central-West Regional Energy Market (CWREM), the North Seas Countries' Offshore Grid Initiative (NSCOGI), the Pentalateral Energy Forum, Interconnections for South-West Europe and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Member States are encouraged to envisage cooperation with signatories to the Energy Community, third-country members of the European Economic Area and, where appropriate, with other relevant third countries. Moreover, the Commission may, with a view to promoting market integration, cost-efficient policies, effective cooperation, partnerships and consultations, identify further opportunities for regional cooperation covering one or more of the five dimensions of the Energy Union in accordance with this Regulation, with a long-term vision and based on existing market conditions.",
      "Regional cooperation is key to ensuring the effective achievement of the objectives of the Energy Union in a cost-optimal manner. The Commission should facilitate such cooperation between the Member States. Member States should get the opportunity to comment on other Member States' integrated national energy and climate plans before they are finalised to avoid inconsistencies and potential negative impacts on other Member States and ensure that common objectives are met collectively. Regional cooperation in elaborating and finalising integrated national energy and climate plans as well as in their subsequent implementation should be essential to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of measures and fostering market integration and energy security.",
      "The Commission may undertake discussions with relevant third countries in order to explore the possibility to extend towards them the application of provisions established under this Regulation, in particular those related to regional cooperation."
