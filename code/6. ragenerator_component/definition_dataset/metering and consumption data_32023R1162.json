This way, interoperability is ensured in a manner that respects consumer rights over their data, and market participants have a shared understanding of the type of data and workflows that are required for specific services and processes. Customers can be required to give permission to suppliers or other market participants such as aggregators as part of their contractual agreements. Where a customer terminates their contract with a supplier or other market participant, the supplier or market participant should continue to have access to the metering data necessary for billing or balancing purposes. Member States may require certain metering data to be shared for legitimate public purposes, for instance with environmental or statistical authorities as well as with system operators or other market participants.",
