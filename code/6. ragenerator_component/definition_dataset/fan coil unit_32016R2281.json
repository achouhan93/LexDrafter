  "original_definition": "'fan coil unit' means a device that provides forced circulation of indoor air, for the purpose of one or more of heating, cooling, dehumidification and filtering of indoor air, for the thermal comfort of human beings, but which does not include the source of heating or cooling nor an outdoor side heat exchanger. The device may be equipped with minimal ductwork to guide the intake and exit of air, including conditioned air. The product may be designed to be built in or may have an enclosure allowing it be placed in the space to be conditioned. It may include a Joule effect heat generator designed to be used as back-up heater only;",
