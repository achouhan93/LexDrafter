      "Each balancing service provider intending to provide balancing energy or balancing capacity should successfully pass a qualification process defined by the TSOs in close cooperation with DSOs where necessary.",
      "This Regulation establishes an EU-wide set of technical, operational and market rules to govern the functioning of electricitybalancing markets. It sets out rules for the procurement ofbalancing capacity, the activation ofbalancing energy and the financial settlement of balance responsible parties. It also requires the development of harmonised methodologies for the allocation of cross-zonal transmission capacity for balancing purposes. Such rules will increase the liquidity of short-term markets by allowing for more cross-border trade and for a more efficient use of the existing grid for the purposes of balancing energy. As balancing energy bids will compete on EU-wide balancing platforms, it will also have positive effects on competition."
