At the end of the mass balance period, the sustainability data carried forward should be equivalent to the physical stock in the container, processing or logistical facility, transmission and distribution infrastructure or site;",

Applicants can be a farm, a group of farmers or a first gathering point or a group manager acting on behalf of a group of farmers.
