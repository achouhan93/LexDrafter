      "In the preparation of the initial on-site audit as well as during subsequent surveillance or re-certification audits, the auditor should make an appropriate analysis of the overall risk profile of economic operators. Based on the auditor\u2019s professional knowledge and the information submitted by the economic operator, this analysis should take into consideration not only the level of risk of the specific economic operator but also of the supply chain (e.g. for economic operators that handle materials listed in Annex IX to Directive (EU) 2018/2001). The audit intensity, its scope, or both, should be adapted to the level of identified overall risk in order to ensure an adequate level of trust in the veracity of the information provided by the economic operators, mitigating the risks for material misstatements."
