  "original_definition": "'cost-optimal level' means the energy performance level which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated economic lifecycle, where:the lowest cost is determined taking into account energy-related investment costs, maintenance and operating costs (including energy costs and savings, the category of building concerned, earnings from energy produced), where applicable, and disposal costs, where applicable; andthe estimated economic lifecycle is determined by each Member State. It refers to the remaining estimated economic lifecycle of a building where energy performance requirements are set for the building as a whole, or to the estimated economic lifecycle of a building element where energy performance requirements are set for building elements.The cost-optimal level shall lie within the range of performance levels where the cost benefit analysis calculated over the estimated economic lifecycle is positive;",
  "generated_definition": "'cost-optimal level' means the cost-optimal level of minimum energy performance requirements is the most energy-efficient level achievable, taking into account the relevant parameters such as climatic conditions and practical accessibility of energy infrastructure, and compared to the minimum energy performance requirements in force.",
