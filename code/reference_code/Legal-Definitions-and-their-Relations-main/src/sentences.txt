		This Regulation lays down rules on specific requirements for official controls and applicable measures for cases of non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with Union rules applicable to the use of authorised, unauthorised or prohibited pharmacologically active substances on food-producing animals and to their residues.

		(3)  Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 152, 16.6.2009, p. 11).

		during the transport, distribution and sale or acquisition of pharmacologically active substances;

		the withdrawal period established under the Regulation authorising the use of a certain pharmacologically active substance as a feed additive in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.

		Follow-up on residues of pharmacologically active substances authorised in veterinary medicinal products or as feed additives, exceeding the applicable maximum residue limits or maximum levels

		1.   Where the maximum residue limits for pharmacologically active substances authorised in veterinary medicinal products or as feed additives, set on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, or, where the maximum levels for residues of pharmacologically active substances resulting from the unavoidable carry-over of these substances in non-target feed, set on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 315/93, have been exceeded, thereby establishing non-compliance, the competent authority, shall:

		Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) requires Member States to notify a direct or indirect risk to human health deriving from food or feed via the network, which has been put in place for this purpose. Non-compliances related to residues of pharmacologically active substances and constituting such risks should therefore be notified accordingly. In addition, where the non-compliances are identified in relation to animals or products of animal origin originating from another Member State, the authorities of the Member State having identified the non-compliance and the Member State of origin should make use of the provisions on assistance set out in Regulation (EU) 2017/625 and take the appropriate follow-up measures, as defined in the present Regulation.

		1.   Where the maximum residue limits for pharmacologically active substances authorised in veterinary medicinal products or as feed additives, set on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 have been exceeded or, where the maximum levels for residues of pharmacologically active substances resulting from the unavoidable carry-over of these substances in non-target feed, set on the basis of Regulation (EEC) No 315/93, have been exceeded, the competent authority shall:

		Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) laying down rules for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in food of animal origin and for placing on the market food of animal origin containing residues of pharmacologically active substances;

		Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 (4), which classifies pharmacologically active substances in light of their prohibition or the maximum residue limits applicable to them;

		3.   Where residues are suspected at levels exceeding the maximum residue limits or maximum levels for pharmacologically active substances authorised in veterinary medicinal products or as feed additives, set under Union legislation, the competent authority shall carry out any measure of investigation which it deems appropriate.

		In view of the specificities of the actions and controls to be taken in case of suspected or established non-compliance with Union rules applicable to the use of pharmacologically active substances on food-producing animals and to their residues, and in order to ensure an Union-wide uniform application of enforcement actions, the cases where the measures listed in Articles 137 and 138 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 are to be taken should be specified to tailor them to this sector.

		supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and Council regarding cases of suspected or established non-compliance with Union rules applicable to the use or residues of pharmacologically active substances authorised in veterinary medicinal products or as feed additives or with Union rules applicable to the use or residues of prohibited or unauthorised pharmacologically active substances

		The rules laid down in this Regulation should ensure, within the framework of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, a continuation of the requirements on the follow-up of suspected or established non-compliance with the rules applicable to the use or residues of pharmacologically active substances authorised in veterinary medicinal products or as feed additives or with Union rules applicable to the use or residues of prohibited or unauthorised pharmacologically active substances, in particular as laid down in:

		Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) establishes the regulatory framework for the placing on the market, manufacturing, import, export, supply, distribution, pharmacovigilance, control and the use of veterinary medicinal products. Pharmacologically active substances, which are not authorised in veterinary medicinal products, are not to be used on food-producing animals, with the exception of the use of substances essential for the treatment of equidae, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006. Follow-up on established or suspected non-compliances related to the use of veterinary medicinal products which have a suspected or established impact on food safety falls within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 and of this Regulation. Directive 2001/82/EC has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) 2019/6 of the European Parliament and the Council on veterinary medicinal products (the new VMP Regulation) (12) which is to apply from 28 January 2022 and which amongst others provides for restrictions on the use in animals of antimicrobial veterinary medicinal products.

		‘pharmacologically active substance’ means any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a veterinary medicinal product that, when used in its production, becomes an active ingredient of that product;

		5.   The official controls referred to in this Article may also include controls on manufacturers, distributors, transporters, production sites of pharmacologically active substances and veterinary medicinal products, pharmacies, all relevant actors in the supply-chain and any other site concerned by the investigation.

		(4)  Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin

		2.   Where residues are identified at concentrations below the maximum residue limits for pharmacologically active substances authorised in veterinary medicinal products or as feed additives, but where the presence of those residues is inconsistent with the food chain information, thereby creating a suspicion of non-compliance or illegal treatment, the competent authority shall carry out any measure of investigation which it deems appropriate for investigating the source of these residues or the deficiencies in the food chain information.

		‘unauthorised substances’ means pharmacologically active substances, which are not included in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 or substances that are not authorised as a feed additive under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, with the exception of substances essential for the treatment of equidae and substances bringing added clinical benefit compared to other treatment options available for equidae, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1950/2006.

		The rules set out in Directive 96/23/EC ensure the harmonised enforcement of the EU food safety legislation related to the use and residues of pharmacologically active substances. In order to rationalise and simplify the overall legislative framework, the rules applicable to official controls in specific areas of the agri-food chain legislation have been integrated into the framework for official controls defined by Regulation (EU) 2017/625. In order to ensure a continued and harmonised enforcement, the rules of Directive 96/23/EC related to the follow-up to non-compliances, should be integrated in the new legal framework under Regulation (EU) 2017/625.
