Registry,"The Commission should promote cooperation between the Registry, the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and other Union agencies, with a view to combating the speculative and abusive registrations of domain names, including cybersquatting, and providing simple administrative procedures, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
Registry,"To ensure the better protection of the right of the parties to contract with, respectively, the Registry and Registrars, disputes with regard to the registration of domain names in the .eu TLD should be solved by bodies located in the Union applying the relevant national law, without prejudice to rights and obligations recognised by the Member States or by the Union arising from international instruments."
Registry,"The Commission should, on the basis of an open, transparent and non-discriminatory selection procedure, having regard to cost-efficiency and administrative simplicity, designate a Registry for the .eu TLD. In order to support the digital single market, to build an online European identity and to encourage cross-border online activities, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the eligibility and selection criteria and the procedure for the designation of the Registry. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (5). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts."

Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). Such lists should be compiled subject to the domain names' availability taking into account domain names at second level already reserved or registered by the Member States."

Registry,"The Registry should enter into an appropriate escrow agreement to ensure continuity of service, and in particular to ensure that it is possible to continue to provide services to the local internet community with minimum disruption in the event of re-delegation or other unforeseen circumstances. The Registry should submit an electronic copy of the current content of the .eu TLD database to the escrow agent on a daily basis."
Registry,"The policy on the abusive registration of .eu domain names should provide for verification by the Registry of the data that it receives, specifically data concerning the identity of registrants, as well as revocation and blocking from future registration of domain names considered by a final decision of a Member State court to be defamatory, racist or otherwise contrary to the law of the Member State.

Registry,"In order to ensure effective periodic supervision, the Registry should be audited at its own expense at least every two years by an independent body with the purpose of confirming, by means of a conformity assessment report, that the Registry complies with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.
